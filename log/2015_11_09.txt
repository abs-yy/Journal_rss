<h3><b>Broadly Neutralizing Alphavirus Antibodies Bind an Epitope on E2 and Inhibit Entry and Egress</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Julie M. Fox, Feng Long, Melissa A. Edeling, Hueylie Lin, Mareike K.S. van Duijl-Richter, Rachel H. Fong, Kristen M. Kahle, Jolanda M. Smit, Jing Jin, Graham Simmons, Benjamin J. Doranz, James E. Crowe, Daved H. Fremont, Michael G. Rossmann, Michael S. Diamond<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>A class of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies identified here protects against infection and disease in vivo against multiple alphaviruses, including chikungunya. These antibodies bind a discrete epitope on the alphavirus E2 glycoprotein, block viral entry and egress, and allow cross-linking of adjacent E2 protein spikes, suggesting avenues for possible vaccine- or antibody-based therapeutic development against multiple alphaviruses.</p>

<h3><b>5′ UTR mA Promotes Cap-Independent Translation</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Kate D. Meyer, Deepak P. Patil, Jun Zhou, Alexandra Zinoviev, Maxim A. Skabkin, Olivier Elemento, Tatyana V. Pestova, Shu-Bing Qian, Samie R. Jaffrey<br>
Date: 2015-10-22</p>
<p>N6-methyladenosine (m6A) residues within the 5′ UTR of mRNAs promote translation initiation through a mechanism that does not require the 5′ cap or cap-binding proteins. Diverse cellular stresses selectively increase the levels of m6A within 5′ UTRs, suggesting that 5′ UTR m6A is important for mediating stress-induced translational responses.</p>

<h3><b>Net Works for Malaria Control</b></h3>
<p>In just a couple days, Youyou Tu, William C. Campbell and Satoshi Ōmura will meet His Majesty King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Tu’s discovery of artemisinin, a potent anti-malarial. and Campbell and Ōmura’s work on ivermectin, a broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug, has helped to mitigate the burden of parasitic diseases, especially in the developing world. Despite all effort and advances, stopping the spread of preventable parasitic diseases remains an unmet goal.</p>

<h3><b>Radical Sabbaticals</b></h3>
<p>Growing up, I believed that academics were shielded from the clutter of everyday life and had the peace to think, discuss, perform the occasional experiment and think some more. After starting a research lab, however, I discovered there was not much peace in academia. The day was just not long enough to fit everything in, and though a sabbatical leave always lurked at the horizon, there never seemed to be a good moment to take a break.</p>

<h3><b>Aire Gets Company for Immune Tolerance</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Ludger Klein<br>
Date: 2015-11-05</p>
<p>A specialized subset of epithelial cells in the thymus “promiscuously” transcribes thousands of peripheral genes to ensure that developing T cells can test their antigen receptors for dangerous autoreactivity. New findings by Takaba et al. indicate that the transcription factor Fezf2 acts independently of Aire in thymic epithelial cells to generate “genetic noise” for immunological tolerance.</p>

<h3><b>SnapShot: T Cell Exhaustion</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Kristen E. Pauken, E. John Wherry<br>
Date: 2015-11-05</p>
<p>Exhaustion is a state of T cell differentiation common during chronic infection and cancer that results in T cell dysfunction. Exhausted T cells (TEX) progressively lose effector functions and develop defects in memory T cell properties due to exposure to persistent antigen and inflammation. Exhaustion can be reversed, at least partially, by blocking inhibitory pathways such as PD-1, resulting in improved pathogen or tumor control. To view this SnapShot, open or download the PDF.</p>

<h3><b>A Gut Feeling about You</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Corinne F. Maurice<br>
Date: 2015-11-05</p>
<p>The “gut microbiota” is rapidly becoming a common term outside of the halls of science: it has been headlined in the New York Times, is the subject of several non-fiction books, and is regularly promoted on TV (probiotics, anyone…?). Many non-scientists may not remember or know the technical term microbiota, but mention the gut flora to them, and they’ll probably know what you’re referring to.</p>

<h3><b>Adopting Rare Diseases</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Mustafa Sahin<br>
Date: 2015-11-05</p>
<p>In the United States, rare diseases are defined as conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals at any given time. Worldwide, an estimated 300 million people are affected by rare diseases, also known as “orphan diseases” because with few financial incentives for developing new treatments, the pharmaceutical industry did not “adopt” them. In his book entitled Orphan, Phillip Reilly paints a picture of several rare diseases and the quest to find treatments for them.</p>

<h3><b>Histone Marks Direct Chromosome Segregation</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Vincenzo Pirrotta<br>
Date: 2015-11-05</p>
<p>Germline stem cells divide asymmetrically, producing a self-renewing stem cell and a differentiating progenitor. Xie et al. now show that this depends on two asymmetric events that together partition a genome copy, carrying the old histones to the stem cell daughter and a copy with new, unmarked histones to the differentiating daughter.</p>

<h3><b>Cardiomyocytes Replicate and their Numbers Increase in Young Hearts</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Nawazish Naqvi, Reena Singh, Siiri E. Iismaa, Ming Li, John W. Calvert, David I.K. Martin, Richard P. Harvey, Robert M. Graham, Ahsan Husain<br>
Date: 2015-11-05</p>
<p>In mice, the heart nearly quadruples in size from early preadolescence (postnatal day 10 [P10]) to puberty (∼P35) (Naqvi et al., 2014). Because it is widely believed that mammalian cardiomyocytes (CMs) are incapable of replication after birth, it has been assumed that early postnatal heart growth is driven solely by CM hypertrophy. Our findings question this view and provide insights into how thyroid hormone may regulate an increase in CM number during preadolescence. Alkass et al. (2015) and Soonpaa et al.</p>

<h3><b>Cardiomyocyte Cell-Cycle Activity during Preadolescence</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Mark H. Soonpaa, David C. Zebrowski, Colin Platt, Anthony Rosenzweig, Felix B. Engel, Loren J. Field<br>
Date: 2015-11-05</p>
<p>Earlier studies (Soonpaa et al., 1996) revealed a rapid drop-off of ventricular cardiomyocyte cell-cycle activity at birth in mice, followed by a burst of DNA synthesis during the first week of postnatal life which contributed to the formation of multi-nucleated cardiomyocytes by postnatal day 10 (PN10). It has recently been suggested that a second burst of cardiomyocyte cell-cycle activity occurs during preadolescence, between PN14 and PN18, resulting in a 40% increase in cardiomyocyte number (Naqvi et al., 2014).</p>

<h3><b>No Evidence for Cardiomyocyte Number Expansion in Preadolescent Mice</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Kanar Alkass, Joni Panula, Mattias Westman, Ting-Di Wu, Jean-Luc Guerquin-Kern, Olaf Bergmann<br>
Date: 2015-11-05</p>
<p>Contrary to a recent report suggesting that a preadolescent burst of cardiomyocyte proliferation promotes heart growth, cardiomyocyte number expansion appears limited to the neonatal period, with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy likely accounting for the increase in the heart size.</p>

Date: 2015-11-05</p>
<p>Estrogen receptor β (ERβ) plays a unique role in endometriotic tissue, where it interacts with the cytoplasmic apoptotic machinery and inflammasome complex to prevent TNF-α-induced cell death and enhance adhesion and proliferative activities of endometriotic tissues. This non-genomic action of ERβ has a predominant role in endometriosis progression.</p>

<h3><b>Vesicle-Mediated Steroid Hormone Secretion in </b></h3>
<p>Authors:Naoki Yamanaka, Guillermo Marqués, Michael B. O’Connor<br>
Date: 2015-11-05</p>
<p>The release of the steroid hormone ecdysone in Drosophila is mediated through a vesicular trafficking mechanism regulated via calcium signaling, suggesting that steroid hormones may be actively released from cells, as opposed to simply diffusing across the membrane.</p>

<p>Lysine acetylation on numerous mitochondrial proteins, targeted by the sirtuin deacylase SIRT3, has been proposed to play a major role in regulating diverse mitochondrial functions, particularly in the liver. A new study by Weinert, Choudhary, and colleagues, in this issue of <I>The EMBO Journal,</I> finds that the absolute levels of hepatic mitochondrial protein acetylation in wild-type mice are extremely low and may be insufficient to exert regulatory effects.</p>

<p>MicroRNAs have emerged as crucial regulators of neuronal function, suggesting that aberrant microRNA expression might contribute to pathologies of the nervous system. In this issue of <I>The EMBO Journal</I>, Emde <I>et&nbsp;al</I> (<cross-ref type="misc" refid="embj201592805-bib-0003">2015</cross-ref>) report a global decrease in microRNAs as common hallmark of different forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Strikingly, enhancing microRNA biogenesis has beneficial effects on the neuromuscular function in mouse models of ALS. Thus, the microRNA pathway represents a promising novel target for therapeutic intervention in neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>The SMC5/6 complex is the least understood of SMC complexes. In yeast, <I>smc5/6</I> mutants phenocopy mutations in <I>sgs1</I>, the BLM ortholog that is deficient in Bloom's syndrome (BS). We here show that NSMCE2 (Mms21, in <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I>), an essential SUMO ligase of the SMC5/6 complex, suppresses cancer and aging in mice. Surprisingly, a mutation that compromises NSMCE2-dependent SUMOylation does not have a detectable impact on murine lifespan. In contrast, NSMCE2 deletion in adult mice leads to pathologies resembling those found in patients of BS. Moreover, and whereas NSMCE2 deletion does not have a detectable impact on DNA replication, NSMCE2-deficient cells also present the cellular hallmarks of BS such as increased recombination rates and an accumulation of micronuclei. Despite the similarities, NSMCE2 and BLM foci do not colocalize and concomitant deletion of <I>Blm</I> and <I>Nsmce2</I> in B lymphocytes further increases recombination rates and is synthetic lethal due to severe chromosome mis-segregation. Our work reveals that SUMO- and BLM-independent activities of NSMCE2 limit recombination and facilitate segregation; functions of the SMC5/6 complex that are necessary to prevent cancer and aging in mice.</p>

<h3><b>Analysis of acetylation stoichiometry suggests that SIRT3 repairs nonenzymatic acetylation lesions</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Weinert, B. T., Moustafa, T., Iesmantavicius, V., Zechner, R., Choudhary, C.<br>
Date: 2015-11-03T02:45:45-08:00</p>
<p>
<p>Acetylation is frequently detected on mitochondrial enzymes, and the sirtuin deacetylase SIRT3 is thought to regulate metabolism by deacetylating mitochondrial proteins. However, the stoichiometry of acetylation has not been studied and is important for understanding whether SIRT3 regulates or suppresses acetylation. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we measured acetylation stoichiometry in mouse liver tissue and found that SIRT3 suppressed acetylation to a very low stoichiometry at its target sites. By examining acetylation changes in the liver, heart, brain, and brown adipose tissue of fasted mice, we found that SIRT3-targeted sites were mostly unaffected by fasting, a dietary manipulation that is thought to regulate metabolism through SIRT3-dependent deacetylation. Globally increased mitochondrial acetylation in fasted liver tissue, higher stoichiometry at mitochondrial acetylation sites, and greater sensitivity of SIRT3-targeted sites to chemical acetylation <I>in&nbsp;vitro</I> and fasting-induced acetylation <I>in&nbsp;vivo</I>, suggest a nonenzymatic mechanism of acetylation. Our data indicate that most mitochondrial acetylation occurs as a low-level nonenzymatic protein lesion and that SIRT3 functions as a protein repair factor that removes acetylation lesions from lysine residues.</p>

<h3><b>Dysregulated miRNA biogenesis downstream of cellular stress and ALS-causing mutations: a new mechanism for ALS</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Emde, A., Eitan, C., Liou, L.-L., Libby, R. T., Rivkin, N., Magen, I., Reichenstein, I., Oppenheim, H., Eilam, R., Silvestroni, A., Alajajian, B., Ben-Dov, I. Z., Aebischer, J., Savidor, A., Levin, Y., Sons, R., Hammond, S. M., Ravits, J. M., Mo&#x0308;ller, T., Hornstein, E.<br>

<p>
<p>Interest in RNA dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) recently aroused upon discovering causative mutations in RNA-binding protein genes. Here, we show that extensive down-regulation of miRNA levels is a common molecular denominator for multiple forms of human ALS. We further demonstrate that pathogenic ALS-causing mutations are sufficient to inhibit miRNA biogenesis at the Dicing step. Abnormalities of the stress response are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration, including ALS. Accordingly, we describe a novel mechanism for modulating microRNA biogenesis under stress, involving stress granule formation and re-organization of DICER and AGO2 protein interactions with their partners. In line with this observation, enhancing DICER activity by a small molecule, enoxacin, is beneficial for neuromuscular function in two independent ALS mouse models. Characterizing miRNA biogenesis downstream of the stress response ties seemingly disparate pathways in neurodegeneration and further suggests that DICER and miRNAs affect neuronal integrity and are possible therapeutic targets.</p>

<h3><b>Distinct preoptic-BST nuclei dissociate paternal and infanticidal behavior in mice</b></h3>

<p>
<p>Paternal behavior is not innate but arises through social experience. After mating and becoming fathers, male mice change their behavior toward pups from infanticide to paternal care. However, the precise brain areas and circuit mechanisms connecting these social behaviors are largely unknown. Here we demonstrated that the c-Fos expression pattern in the four nuclei of the preoptic-bed nuclei of stria terminalis (BST) region could robustly discriminate five kinds of previous social behavior of male mice (parenting, infanticide, mating, inter-male aggression, solitary control). Specifically, neuronal activation in the central part of the medial preoptic area (cMPOA) and rhomboid nucleus of the BST (BSTrh) retroactively detected paternal and infanticidal motivation with more than 95% accuracy. Moreover, cMPOA lesions switched behavior in fathers from paternal to infanticidal, while BSTrh lesions inhibited infanticide in virgin males. The projections from cMPOA to BSTrh were largely GABAergic. Optogenetic or pharmacogenetic activation of cMPOA attenuated infanticide in virgin males. Taken together, this study identifies the preoptic-BST nuclei underlying social motivations in male mice and reveals unexpected complexity in the circuit connecting these nuclei.</p>

<h3><b>Suppression of miR-199a maturation by HuR is crucial for hypoxia-induced glycolytic switch in hepatocellular carcinoma</b></h3>

<p>Glucose metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer. Cancer cells rapidly adjust their energy source from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolytic metabolism in order to efficiently proliferate in a hypoxic environment, but the mechanism underlying this switch is still incompletely understood. Here, we report that hypoxia potently induces the RNA-binding protein HuR to specifically bind primary miR-199a transcript to block miR-199a maturation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. We demonstrate that this hypoxia-suppressed miR-199a plays a decisive role in limiting glycolysis in HCC cells by targeting hexokinase-2 (<I>Hk2</I>) and pyruvate kinase-M2 (<I>Pkm2</I>). Furthermore, systemically delivered cholesterol-modified agomiR-199a inhibits [<sup>18</sup>F]-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and attenuates tumor growth in HCC tumor-bearing mice. These data reveal a novel mechanism of reprogramming of cancer energy metabolism in which HuR suppresses miR-199a maturation to link hypoxia to the Warburg effect and suggest a promising therapeutic strategy that targets miR-199a to interrupt cancerous aerobic glycolysis.</p>

<h3><b>Disruption of adaptor protein 2{mu} (AP-2{mu}) in cochlear hair cells impairs vesicle reloading of synaptic release sites and hearing</b></h3>

<p>
<p>Active zones (AZs) of inner hair cells (IHCs) indefatigably release hundreds of vesicles per second, requiring each release site to reload vesicles at tens per second. Here, we report that the endocytic adaptor protein 2&mu; (AP-2&mu;) is required for release site replenishment and hearing. We show that hair cell-specific disruption of AP-2&mu; slows IHC exocytosis immediately after fusion of the readily releasable pool of vesicles, despite normal abundance of membrane-proximal vesicles and intact endocytic membrane retrieval. Sound-driven postsynaptic spiking was reduced in a use-dependent manner, and the altered interspike interval statistics suggested a slowed reloading of release sites. Sustained strong stimulation led to accumulation of endosome-like vacuoles, fewer clathrin-coated endocytic intermediates, and&nbsp;vesicle depletion of the membrane-distal synaptic ribbon in AP-2&mu;-deficient IHCs, indicating a further role of AP-2&mu; in clathrin-dependent vesicle reformation on a timescale of many seconds. Finally, we show that AP-2 sorts its IHC-cargo otoferlin. We propose that binding of AP-2 to otoferlin facilitates replenishment of release sites, for example, via speeding AZ clearance of exocytosed material, in addition to a role of AP-2 in synaptic vesicle reformation.</p>

<h3><b>Phospholipid methylation controls Atg32-mediated mitophagy and Atg8 recycling</b></h3>

<p>
<p>Degradation of mitochondria via selective autophagy, termed mitophagy, contributes to mitochondrial quality and quantity control whose defects have been implicated in oxidative phosphorylation deficiency, aberrant cell differentiation, and neurodegeneration. How mitophagy is regulated in response to cellular physiology remains obscure. Here, we show that mitophagy in yeast is linked to the phospholipid biosynthesis pathway for conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine by the two methyltransferases Cho2 and Opi3. Under mitophagy-inducing conditions, cells lacking Opi3 exhibit retardation of Cho2 repression that causes an anomalous increase in glutathione levels, leading to suppression of Atg32, a mitochondria-anchored protein essential for mitophagy. In addition, loss of Opi3 results in accumulation of phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (PMME) and, surprisingly, generation of Atg8&ndash;PMME, a mitophagy-incompetent lipid conjugate of the autophagy-related ubiquitin-like modifier. Amelioration of Atg32 expression and attenuation of Atg8&ndash;PMME conjugation markedly rescue mitophagy in <I>opi3</I>-null cells. We propose that proper regulation of phospholipid methylation is crucial for Atg32-mediated mitophagy.</p>

<h3><b>High-frequency, precise modification of the tomato genome</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Tomáš Čermák<br>
Date: 2015-11-06T00:00:00Z</p>
<p>Background:
The use of homologous recombination to precisely modify plant genomes has been challenging, due to the lack of efficient methods for delivering DNA repair templates to plant cells. Even with the advent of sequence-specific nucleases, which stimulate homologous recombination at predefined genomic sites by creating targeted DNA double-strand breaks, there are only a handful of studies that report precise editing of endogenous genes in crop plants. More efficient methods are needed to modify plant genomes through homologous recombination, ideally without randomly integrating foreign DNA.
Results:
Here, we use geminivirus replicons to create heritable modifications to the tomato genome at frequencies tenfold higher than traditional methods of DNA delivery (i.e., Agrobacterium). A strong promoter was inserted upstream of a gene controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis, resulting in overexpression and ectopic accumulation of pigments in tomato tissues. More than two-thirds of the insertions were precise, and had no unanticipated sequence modifications. Both TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 achieved gene targeting at similar efficiencies. Further, the targeted modification was transmitted to progeny in a Mendelian fashion. Even though donor molecules were replicated in the vectors, no evidence was found of persistent extra-chromosomal replicons or off-target integration of T-DNA or replicon sequences.
Conclusions:
High-frequency, precise modification of the tomato genome was achieved using geminivirus replicons, suggesting that these vectors can overcome the efficiency barrier that has made gene targeting in plants challenging. This work provides a foundation for efficient genome editing of crop genomes without the random integration of foreign DNA.</p>

<h3><b>Spatio-temporal regulation of circular RNA expression during porcine embryonic brain development</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Morten Venø<br>
Date: 2015-11-05T00:00:00Z</p>
<p>Background:
Recently, thousands of circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been discovered in various tissues and cell types from human, mouse, fruit fly and nematodes. However, expression of circRNAs across mammalian brain development has never been examined.
Results:
Here we profile the expression of circRNA in five brain tissues at up to six time-points during fetal porcine development, constituting the first report of circRNA in the brain development of a large animal. An unbiased analysis reveals a highly complex regulation pattern of thousands of circular RNAs, with a distinct spatio-temporal expression profile. The amount and complexity of circRNA expression was most pronounced in cortex at day 60 of gestation. At this time-point we find 4634 unique circRNAs expressed from 2195 genes out of a total of 13,854 expressed genes. Approximately 20&#160;% of the porcine splice sites involved in circRNA production are functionally conserved between mouse and human. Furthermore, we observe that &#8220;hot-spot&#8221; genes produce multiple circRNA isoforms, which are often differentially expressed across porcine brain development. A global comparison of porcine circRNAs reveals that introns flanking circularized exons are longer than average and more frequently contain proximal complementary SINEs, which potentially can facilitate base pairing between the flanking introns. Finally, we report the first use of RNase R treatment in combination with in situ hybridization to show dynamic subcellular localization of circRNA during development.
Conclusions:
These data demonstrate that circRNAs are highly abundant and dynamically expressed in a spatio-temporal manner in porcine fetal brain, suggesting important functions during mammalian brain development.</p>

<h3><b>
TLE6 mutation causes the earliest known human embryonic lethality</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Anas Alazami<br>
Date: 2015-11-05T00:00:00Z</p>
<p>Background:
Embryonic lethality is a recognized phenotypic expression of individual gene mutations in model organisms. However, identifying embryonic lethal genes in humans is challenging, especially when the phenotype is manifested at the preimplantation stage.
Results:
In an ongoing effort to exploit the highly consanguineous nature of the Saudi population to catalog recessively acting embryonic lethal genes in humans, we have identified two families with a female-limited infertility phenotype. Using autozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing, we map this phenotype to a single mutation in TLE6, a maternal effect gene that encodes a member of the subcortical maternal complex in mammalian oocytes. Consistent with the published phenotype of mouse Tle6 mutants, embryos from female patients who are homozygous for the TLE6 mutation fail to undergo early cleavage, with resulting sterility. The human mutation abrogates TLE6 phosphorylation, a step that is reported to be critical for the PKA-mediated progression of oocyte meiosis II. Furthermore, the TLE6 mutation impairs its binding to components of the subcortical maternal complex.
Conclusion:
In this first report of a human defect in a member of the subcortical maternal subcritical maternal complex, we show that the TLE6 mutation is gender-specific and leads to the earliest known human embryonic lethality phenotype.</p>

<h3><b>Subtractive assembly for comparative metagenomics, and its application to type 2 diabetes metagenomes</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Mingjie Wang<br>
Date: 2015-11-02T12:00:00Z</p>
<p>Comparative metagenomics remains challenging due to the size and complexity of metagenomic datasets. Here we introduce subtractive assembly, a de novo assembly approach for comparative metagenomics that directly assembles only the differential reads that distinguish between two groups of metagenomes. Using simulated datasets, we show it improves both the efficiency of the assembly and the assembly quality of the differential genomes and genes. Further, its application to type 2 diabetes (T2D) metagenomic datasets reveals clear signatures of the T2D gut microbiome, revealing new phylogenetic and functional features of the gut microbial communities associated with T2D.</p>

<h3><b>ZIFA: Dimensionality reduction for zero-inflated single-cell gene expression analysis</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Emma Pierson<br>
Date: 2015-11-02T12:00:00Z</p>
<p>Single-cell RNA-seq data allows insight into normal cellular function and various disease states through molecular characterization of gene expression on the single cell level. Dimensionality reduction of such high-dimensional data sets is essential for visualization and analysis, but single-cell RNA-seq data are challenging for classical dimensionality-reduction methods because of the prevalence of dropout events, which lead to zero-inflated data. Here, we develop a dimensionality-reduction method, (Z)ero (I)nflated (F)actor (A)nalysis (ZIFA), which explicitly models the dropout characteristics, and show that it improves modeling accuracy on simulated and biological data sets.</p>

<h3><b>WU-CRISPR: characteristics of functional guide RNAs for the CRISPR/Cas9 system</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Nathan Wong<br>
Date: 2015-11-02T00:00:00Z</p>
<p>The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been rapidly adopted for genome editing. However, one major issue with this system is the lack of robust bioinformatics tools for design of single guide RNA (sgRNA), which determines the efficacy and specificity of genome editing. To address this pressing need, we analyze CRISPR RNA-seq data and identify many novel features that are characteristic of highly potent sgRNAs. These features are used to develop a bioinformatics tool for genome-wide design of sgRNAs with improved efficiency. These sgRNAs as well as the design tool are freely accessible via a web server, WU-CRISPR (http://crispr.wustl.edu).</p>

<h3><b>Network analysis of gene essentiality in functional genomics experiments</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Peng Jiang<br>
Date: 2015-10-30T12:00:00Z</p>
<p>Many genomic techniques have been developed to study gene essentiality genome-wide, such as CRISPR and shRNA screens. Our analyses of public CRISPR screens suggest protein interaction networks, when integrated with gene expression or histone marks, are highly predictive of gene essentiality. Meanwhile, the quality of CRISPR and shRNA screen results can be significantly enhanced through network neighbor information. We also found network neighbor information to be very informative on prioritizing ChIP-seq target genes and survival indicator genes from tumor profiling. Thus, our study provides a general method for gene essentiality analysis in functional genomic experiments (http://nest.dfci.harvard.edu).</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Examining the role of SLP-76 pY173 in ITK-mediated activation/phosphorylation of PLC&gamma;1.</li>
	<li>
		PLC&gamma;1 adopts an autoinhibited conformation in solution consistent with the reported crystal structure of tandem SH2 domains.</li>
	<li>
		The SLP-76 pY173 peptide contains an unusual arginine in the pY + 3 position yet binds to the C-terminal SH2 domain of PLC&gamma;1 disfavoring the autoinhibited form.</li>
	<li>
		Binding of SLP-76 pY173 enhances ITK-mediated phosphorylation of PLC&gamma;1</li>
	<li>
		The results add a new function&mdash;substrate priming&mdash;to the important scaffolding functions of the T cell signaling protein SLP-76.</li>

<p>
	<strong>Highlights</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The organization of cMyBP-C in the cardiac muscle sarcomere is controversial.</li>
	<li>
		Cardiac muscle myofibrils were labeled with domain-specific antibodies to cMyBP-C.</li>
	<li>
		The antibodies revealed the axial positions of different domains of cMyBP-C.</li>
	<li>
		Different domains were located at the same axial positions along the thick filament.</li>
	<li>
		We conclude that most of cMyBP-C is oriented perpendicular to the thick filament.</li>

<p>
	<strong>Highlights</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Interactions determining protein aggregation in complex mixture are as selective as antibody&ndash;target interactions.</li>
	<li>
		This results from the sequence properties of cellular proteomes in which most aggregation-prone sequences are unique.</li>
	<li>
		As aggregation-associated interactions are specific, only homologous sequences will co-aggregate.</li>
	<li>
		This implies that, in the event of physiological stress, individual aggregation events remain isolated without affecting other protein functions.</li>

<p>
	<strong>Highlights</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Computational modeling and simulation combined with NMR and fluorescence experiments inform and resolve a controversy on tRNA selectivity in the ribosome.</li>
	<li>
		Free energy calculations of adenine flipping for A-site adenines 1492/1493 indicate that 3&ndash;4 kcal/mol selectivity arises from coupling adenines with the mRNA&ndash;tRNA minihelix.</li>
	<li>
		The strain associated with moving from the more open form and the closed form accounts for nearly 4 kcal/mol in selectivity.</li>
	<li>
		The free energy cost of keto to enol tautomerization is about 7 kcal/mol in the context of the ribosome with bound tRNA and mRNA, thus suggesting that it is unlikely.</li>

	&bull;&nbsp;The structure of a bacterial sodium channel was determined by electron crystallography.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;A crystal contains two conformations reconstituted into lipid bilayers.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Structural differences elucidated the key parts involved in widening the inner gate.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;The different parts were confirmed by mutational and electrophysiological analyses.<br />

<h3><b>Featured Articles: The UBE2E Proteins as Conjugating Dispersers: Extending Function with Extended Extensions ☆</b></h3>
<p>
                        <p>
	<strong>Highlights</strong><br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Background: E2 conjugating enzymes have a central role in the ubiquitylation cascade and can determine the architecture of ubiquitin modifications. Some E2s comprise just the conserved core domain, whereas others have N- and C-terminal extensions.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Result: Here, we show that the ubiquitin-conjugating domain of UBE2E proteins can build polyubiquitin chains, but the N-terminal extension of this family of E2 proteins limits polyubiquitylation. As a consequence, the unmodified full-length proteins preferentially monoubiquitylate target proteins.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Significance: The UBE2E family of proteins interact with numerous E3 ligases, including many that also interact with the chain building UBE2D family; therefore, the selective recruitment of these two E2s may influence the nature of the modification attached to target proteins.</p>

<h3><b>Top consumer abundance influences lake methane efflux</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Shawn P. Devlin<br>
Date: 2015-11-04</p>
<p>
 How aquatic communities influence biogeochemical cycling is not well understood. Here, Devlin  et al.  manipulate the abundance of fish in a whole-lake experiment and show that methane efflux is reduced by the presence of top predators, via a trophic cascade from zooplankton to methanotrophic bacteria.</p>

<h3><b>Asparagine requirement in Plasmodium berghei as a target to prevent malaria transmission and liver infections</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Viswanathan A. Nagaraj<br>
Date: 2015-11-04</p>
<p>
 Malaria parasites obtain amino acids primarily from the host, but possess a gene encoding a putative asparagine synthetase. Here, the authors show that this enzyme is functional and that asparagine is crucial for the development of the parasite’s sexual stages in mosquitoes and liver stages in mice.</p>

<p>Authors:Toyoshi Yanagihara<br>
Date: 2015-11-04</p>
<p>
 Jmjd6 is a dioxygenase that catalyses lysyl hydroxylation of splicing regulatory proteins. Here the authors show that Jmjd6 directs splicing of a central tolerance regulator Aire in medullary thymic epithelial cells, and that Jmjd6 deficiency leads to loss of Aire and multi-organ autoimmunity in mice.</p>

<p>
 The c-Jun transcription factor can mediate a cell's response to TNFa. Here, Riesenberg  et al . show in melanoma cells that c-Jun has an inverse relationship with the key melanocyte transcription factor MITF and that high c-Jun levels contribute to melanoma heterogeneity and an inflammatory microenvironment.</p>

<h3><b>Suction-based propulsion as a basis for efficient animal swimming</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Brad J. Gemmell<br>
Date: 2015-11-03</p>
<p>
 Swimming animals are generally assumed to generate forward thrust by pushing surrounding water rearwards. Here, Gemmell  et al.  show that efficient swimming in lampreys and jellyfish is achieved primarily through suction, as vortex-associated low pressure regions are synchronized by undulations of the body.</p>

<h3><b>Diamond formation due to a pH drop during fluid–rock interactions</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Dimitri A. Sverjensky<br>
Date: 2015-11-03</p>
<p>
 The cause of diamond precipitation has previously been attributed to poorly understood redox changes at depth. Here, the authors propose that a drop in pH during water–rock interactions leads to diamond formation as a consequence of the migration of reactive fluids at elevated temperatures and pressures.</p>

<p>
 The accumulation of chemoreceptor proteins at bacterial poles is thought to depend on their clustering into arrays. Strahl  et al.  show that in  Bacillus subtilis , the chemoreceptor TlpA uses high membrane curvature as a spatial cue for polar localization, through the intrinsic curvature sensitivity of the receptor complex.</p>

<h3><b>DNA damage-induced metaphase I arrest is mediated by the spindle assembly checkpoint and maternal age</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Petros Marangos<br>
Date: 2015-11-02</p>
<p>
 DNA damage in mammalian oocytes can lead to infertility and developmental disorders. Here Marangos  et al.  show that the spindle assembly checkpoint responds to DNA damage by arresting oocytes in metaphase I, and this checkpoint becomes compromised as mice age.</p>

<p>Authors:Alessandra Rosati<br>

<p>
             BAG3 is found in the serum of pancreatic cancer patients and can be
            used as a marker of disease, but its role in cancer is unclear. Here, the authors show
            that BAG3 secreted from tumour cells binds to and activates macrophages, which in turn
            promotes cell growth, and an antibody blocking BAG3 binding reduces tumour formation in
            mice.</p>

<h3><b>Episodic molecular outflow in the very young protostellar cluster Serpens South</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Adele L. Plunkett<br>
Date: 2015-11-04</p>
<p>The loss of mass from protostars, in the form of a jet or outflow, is a necessary counterpart to protostellar mass accretion. Outflow ejection events probably vary in their velocity and/or in the rate of mass loss. Such ‘episodic’ ejection events have been observed during the class 0 protostellar phase (the early accretion stage), and continue during the subsequent class I phase that marks the first one million years of star formation. Previously observed episodic-ejection sources were relatively isolated; however, the most common sites of star formation are clusters. Outflows link protostars with their environment and provide a viable source of the turbulence that is necessary for regulating star formation in clusters, but it is not known how an accretion-driven jet or outflow in a clustered environment manifests itself in its earliest stage. This early stage is important in establishing the initial conditions for momentum and energy transfer to the environment as the protostar and cluster evolve. Here we report that an outflow from a young, class 0 protostar, at the hub of the very active and filamentary Serpens South protostellar cluster, shows unambiguous episodic events. The 12C16O (J = 2−1) emission from the protostar reveals 22 distinct features of outflow ejecta, the most recent having the highest velocity. The outflow forms bipolar lobes—one of the first detectable signs of star formation—which originate from the peak of 1-mm continuum emission. Emission from the surrounding C18O envelope shows kinematics consistent with rotation and an infall of material onto the protostar. The data suggest that episodic, accretion-driven outflow begins in the earliest phase of protostellar evolution, and that the outflow remains intact in a very clustered environment, probably providing efficient momentum transfer for driving turbulence.</p>

<p>Authors:Kenji Toyoda<br>
Date: 2015-11-04</p>
<p>The quantum statistics of bosons and fermions manifest themselves in the manner in which two indistinguishable particles interfere quantum mechanically. When two photons, which are bosonic particles, enter a beam-splitter with one photon in each input port, they bunch together at either of the two output ports. The corresponding disappearance of the coincidence count is the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect. Here we show the phonon counterpart of this effect in a system of trapped-ion phonons, which are collective excitations derived by quantizing vibrational motions that obey Bose–Einstein statistics. We realize a beam-splitter transformation of the phonons by employing the mutual Coulomb repulsion between ions, and perform a two-phonon quantum interference experiment using that transformation. We observe an almost perfect disappearance of the phonon coincidence between two ion sites, confirming that phonons can be considered indistinguishable bosonic particles. The two-particle interference demonstrated here is purely a quantum effect, without a classical counterpart, hence it should be possible to demonstrate the existence of entanglement on this basis. We attempt to generate an entangled state of phonons at the centre of the Hong–Ou–Mandel dip in the coincidence temporal profile, under the assumption that the entangled phonon state is successfully generated if the fidelity of the analysis pulses is taken into account adequately. Two-phonon interference, as demonstrated here, proves the bosonic nature of phonons in a trapped-ion system. It opens the way to establishing phonon modes as carriers of quantum information in their own right, and could have implications for the quantum simulation of bosonic particles and analogue quantum computation via boson sampling.</p>

<h3><b>An aqueous, polymer-based redox-flow battery using non-corrosive, safe, and low-cost materials</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Tobias Janoschka<br>
Date: 2015-10-21</p>
<p>For renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric to be effectively used in the grid of the future, flexible and scalable energy-storage solutions are necessary to mitigate output fluctuations. Redox-flow batteries (RFBs) were first built in the 1940s and are considered a promising large-scale energy-storage technology. A limited number of redox-active materials—mainly metal salts, corrosive halogens, and low-molar-mass organic compounds—have been investigated as active materials, and only a few membrane materials, such as Nafion, have been considered for RFBs. However, for systems that are intended for both domestic and large-scale use, safety and cost must be taken into account as well as energy density and capacity, particularly regarding long-term access to metal resources, which places limits on the lithium-ion-based and vanadium-based RFB development. Here we describe an affordable, safe, and scalable battery system, which uses organic polymers as the charge-storage material in combination with inexpensive dialysis membranes, which separate the anode and the cathode by the retention of the non-metallic, active (macro-molecular) species, and an aqueous sodium chloride solution as the electrolyte. This water- and polymer-based RFB has an energy density of 10 watt hours per litre, current densities of up to 100 milliamperes per square centimetre, and stable long-term cycling capability. The polymer-based RFB we present uses an environmentally benign sodium chloride solution and cheap, commercially available filter membranes instead of highly corrosive acid electrolytes and expensive membrane materials.</p>

<h3><b>Spontaneous droplet trampolining on rigid superhydrophobic surfaces</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Thomas M. Schutzius<br>
Date: 2015-11-04</p>
<p>Spontaneous removal of condensed matter from surfaces is exploited in nature and in a broad range of technologies to achieve self-cleaning, anti-icing and condensation control. But despite much progress, our understanding of the phenomena leading to such behaviour remains incomplete, which makes it challenging to rationally design surfaces that benefit from its manifestation. Here we show that water droplets resting on superhydrophobic textured surfaces in a low-pressure environment can self-remove through sudden spontaneous levitation and subsequent trampoline-like bouncing behaviour, in which sequential collisions with the surface accelerate the droplets. These collisions have restitution coefficients (ratios of relative speeds after and before collision) greater than unity despite complete rigidity of the surface, and thus seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics. However, these restitution coefficients result from an overpressure beneath the droplet produced by fast droplet vaporization while substrate adhesion and surface texture restrict vapour flow. We also show that the high vaporization rates experienced by the droplets and the associated cooling can result in freezing from a supercooled state that triggers a sudden increase in vaporization, which in turn boosts the levitation process. This effect can spontaneously remove surface icing by lifting away icy drops the moment they freeze. Although these observations are relevant only to systems in a low-pressure environment, they show how surface texturing can produce droplet–surface interactions that prohibit liquid and freezing water-droplet retention on surfaces.</p>

<h3><b>Rhodium-catalysed syn-carboamination of alkenes via a transient directing group</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Tiffany Piou<br>
Date: 2015-10-21</p>
<p>Alkenes are the most ubiquitous prochiral functional groups—those that can be converted from achiral to chiral in a single step—that are accessible to synthetic chemists. For this reason, difunctionalization reactions of alkenes (whereby two functional groups are added to the same double bond) are particularly important, as they can be used to produce highly complex molecular architectures. Stereoselective oxidation reactions, including dihydroxylation, aminohydroxylation and halogenation, are well established methods for functionalizing alkenes. However, the intermolecular incorporation of both carbon- and nitrogen-based functionalities stereoselectively across an alkene has not been reported. Here we describe the rhodium-catalysed carboamination of alkenes at the same (syn) face of a double bond, initiated by a carbon–hydrogen activation event that uses enoxyphthalimides as the source of both the carbon and the nitrogen functionalities. The reaction methodology allows for the intermolecular, stereospecific formation of one carbon–carbon and one carbon–nitrogen bond across an alkene, which is, to our knowledge, unprecedented. The reaction design involves the in situ generation of a bidentate directing group and the use of a new cyclopentadienyl ligand to control the reactivity of rhodium. The results provide a new way of synthesizing functionalized alkenes, and should lead to the convergent and stereoselective assembly of amine-containing acyclic molecules.</p>

<h3><b>The genetic sex-determination system predicts adult sex ratios in tetrapods</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Ivett Pipoly<br>
Date: 2015-10-07</p>
<p>The adult sex ratio (ASR) has critical effects on behaviour, ecology and population dynamics, but the causes of variation in ASRs are unclear. Here we assess whether the type of genetic sex determination influences the ASR using data from 344 species in 117 families of tetrapods. We show that taxa with female heterogamety have a significantly more male-biased ASR (proportion of males: 0.55 ± 0.01 (mean ± s.e.m.)) than taxa with male heterogamety (0.43 ± 0.01). The genetic sex-determination system explains 24% of interspecific variation in ASRs in amphibians and 36% in reptiles. We consider several genetic factors that could contribute to this pattern, including meiotic drive and sex-linked deleterious mutations, but further work is needed to quantify their effects. Regardless of the mechanism, the effects of the genetic sex-determination system on the adult sex ratio are likely to have profound effects on the demography and social behaviour of tetrapods.</p>

<h3><b>Differential responses to lithium in hyperexcitable neurons from patients with bipolar disorder</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Jerome Mertens<br>
Date: 2015-10-28</p>
<p>Bipolar disorder is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder that is characterized by intermittent episodes of mania and depression; without treatment, 15% of patients commit suicide. Hence, it has been ranked by the World Health Organization as a top disorder of morbidity and lost productivity. Previous neuropathological studies have revealed a series of alterations in the brains of patients with bipolar disorder or animal models, such as reduced glial cell number in the prefrontal cortex of patients, upregulated activities of the protein kinase A and C pathways and changes in neurotransmission. However, the roles and causation of these changes in bipolar disorder have been too complex to exactly determine the pathology of the disease. Furthermore, although some patients show remarkable improvement with lithium treatment for yet unknown reasons, others are refractory to lithium treatment. Therefore, developing an accurate and powerful biological model for bipolar disorder has been a challenge. The introduction of induced pluripotent stem-cell (iPSC) technology has provided a new approach. Here we have developed an iPSC model for human bipolar disorder and investigated the cellular phenotypes of hippocampal dentate gyrus-like neurons derived from iPSCs of patients with bipolar disorder. Guided by RNA sequencing expression profiling, we have detected mitochondrial abnormalities in young neurons from patients with bipolar disorder by using mitochondrial assays; in addition, using both patch-clamp recording and somatic Ca2+ imaging, we have observed hyperactive action-potential firing. This hyperexcitability phenotype of young neurons in bipolar disorder was selectively reversed by lithium treatment only in neurons derived from patients who also responded to lithium treatment. Therefore, hyperexcitability is one early endophenotype of bipolar disorder, and our model of iPSCs in this disease might be useful in developing new therapies and drugs aimed at its clinical treatment.</p>

<h3><b>Microenvironment-induced PTEN loss by exosomal microRNA primes brain metastasis outgrowth</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Lin Zhang<br>
Date: 2015-10-19</p>
<p>The development of life-threatening cancer metastases at distant organs requires disseminated tumour cells’ adaptation to, and co-evolution with, the drastically different microenvironments of metastatic sites. Cancer cells of common origin manifest distinct gene expression patterns after metastasizing to different organs. Clearly, the dynamic interaction between metastatic tumour cells and extrinsic signals at individual metastatic organ sites critically effects the subsequent metastatic outgrowth. Yet, it is unclear when and how disseminated tumour cells acquire the essential traits from the microenvironment of metastatic organs that prime their subsequent outgrowth. Here we show that both human and mouse tumour cells with normal expression of PTEN, an important tumour suppressor, lose PTEN expression after dissemination to the brain, but not to other organs. The PTEN level in PTEN-loss brain metastatic tumour cells is restored after leaving the brain microenvironment. This brain microenvironment-dependent, reversible PTEN messenger RNA and protein downregulation is epigenetically regulated by microRNAs from brain astrocytes. Mechanistically, astrocyte-derived exosomes mediate an intercellular transfer of PTEN-targeting microRNAs to metastatic tumour cells, while astrocyte-specific depletion of PTEN-targeting microRNAs or blockade of astrocyte exosome secretion rescues the PTEN loss and suppresses brain metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, this adaptive PTEN loss in brain metastatic tumour cells leads to an increased secretion of the chemokine CCL2, which recruits IBA1-expressing myeloid cells that reciprocally enhance the outgrowth of brain metastatic tumour cells via enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate a remarkable plasticity of PTEN expression in metastatic tumour cells in response to different organ microenvironments, underpinning an essential role of co-evolution between the metastatic cells and their microenvironment during the adaptive metastatic outgrowth. Our findings signify the dynamic and reciprocal cross-talk between tumour cells and the metastatic niche; importantly, they provide new opportunities for effective anti-metastasis therapies, especially of consequence for brain metastasis patients.</p>

<h3><b>Autophagy mediates degradation of nuclear lamina</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Zhixun Dou<br>
Date: 2015-10-28</p>
<p>Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a catabolic membrane trafficking process that degrades a variety of cellular constituents and is associated with human diseases. Although extensive studies have focused on autophagic turnover of cytoplasmic materials, little is known about the role of autophagy in degrading nuclear components. Here we report that the autophagy machinery mediates degradation of nuclear lamina components in mammals. The autophagy protein LC3/Atg8, which is involved in autophagy membrane trafficking and substrate delivery, is present in the nucleus and directly interacts with the nuclear lamina protein lamin B1, and binds to lamin-associated domains on chromatin. This LC3–lamin B1 interaction does not downregulate lamin B1 during starvation, but mediates its degradation upon oncogenic insults, such as by activated RAS. Lamin B1 degradation is achieved by nucleus-to-cytoplasm transport that delivers lamin B1 to the lysosome. Inhibiting autophagy or the LC3–lamin B1 interaction prevents activated RAS-induced lamin B1 loss and attenuates oncogene-induced senescence in primary human cells. Our study suggests that this new function of autophagy acts as a guarding mechanism protecting cells from tumorigenesis.</p>

<h3><b>Conformational control of DNA target cleavage by CRISPR–Cas9</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Samuel H. Sternberg<br>
Date: 2015-10-28</p>
<p>Cas9 is an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease that targets foreign DNA for destruction as part of a bacterial adaptive immune system mediated by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). Together with single-guide RNAs, Cas9 also functions as a powerful genome engineering tool in plants and animals, and efforts are underway to increase the efficiency and specificity of DNA targeting for potential therapeutic applications. Studies of off-target effects have shown that DNA binding is far more promiscuous than DNA cleavage, yet the molecular cues that govern strand scission have not been elucidated. Here we show that the conformational state of the HNH nuclease domain directly controls DNA cleavage activity. Using intramolecular Förster resonance energy transfer experiments to detect relative orientations of the Cas9 catalytic domains when associated with on- and off-target DNA, we find that DNA cleavage efficiencies scale with the extent to which the HNH domain samples an activated conformation. We furthermore uncover a surprising mode of allosteric communication that ensures concerted firing of both Cas9 nuclease domains. Our results highlight a proofreading mechanism beyond initial protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) recognition and RNA–DNA base-pairing that serves as a final specificity checkpoint before DNA double-strand break formation.</p>

<h3><b>Crystal structure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from influenza C virus</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Narin Hengrung<br>
Date: 2015-10-26</p>
<p>Negative-sense RNA viruses, such as influenza, encode large, multidomain RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that can both transcribe and replicate the viral RNA genome. In influenza virus, the polymerase (FluPol) is composed of three polypeptides: PB1, PB2 and PA/P3. PB1 houses the polymerase active site, whereas PB2 and PA/P3 contain, respectively, cap-binding and endonuclease domains required for transcription initiation by cap-snatching. Replication occurs through de novo initiation and involves a complementary RNA intermediate. Currently available structures of the influenza A and B virus polymerases include promoter RNA (the 5′ and 3′ termini of viral genome segments), showing FluPol in transcription pre-initiation states. Here we report the structure of apo-FluPol from an influenza C virus, solved by X-ray crystallography to 3.9 Å, revealing a new ‘closed’ conformation. The apo-FluPol forms a compact particle with PB1 at its centre, capped on one face by PB2 and clamped between the two globular domains of P3. Notably, this structure is radically different from those of promoter-bound FluPols. The endonuclease domain of P3 and the domains within the carboxy-terminal two-thirds of PB2 are completely rearranged. The cap-binding site is occluded by PB2, resulting in a conformation that is incompatible with transcription initiation. Thus, our structure captures FluPol in a closed, transcription pre-activation state. This reveals the conformation of newly made apo-FluPol in an infected cell, but may also apply to FluPol in the context of a non-transcribing ribonucleoprotein complex. Comparison of the apo-FluPol structure with those of promoter-bound FluPols allows us to propose a mechanism for FluPol activation. Our study demonstrates the remarkable flexibility of influenza virus RNA polymerase, and aids our understanding of the mechanisms controlling transcription and genome replication.</p>

<h3><b>Structural insight into substrate preference for TET-mediated oxidation</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Lulu Hu<br>
Date: 2015-10-28</p>
<p>DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification. Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins are involved in DNA demethylation through iteratively oxidizing 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Here we show that human TET1 and TET2 are more active on 5mC-DNA than 5hmC/5fC-DNA substrates. We determine the crystal structures of TET2–5hmC-DNA and TET2–5fC-DNA complexes at 1.80 Å and 1.97 Å resolution, respectively. The cytosine portion of 5hmC/5fC is specifically recognized by TET2 in a manner similar to that of 5mC in the TET2–5mC-DNA structure, and the pyrimidine base of 5mC/5hmC/5fC adopts an almost identical conformation within the catalytic cavity. However, the hydroxyl group of 5hmC and carbonyl group of 5fC face towards the opposite direction because the hydroxymethyl group of 5hmC and formyl group of 5fC adopt restrained conformations through forming hydrogen bonds with the 1-carboxylate of NOG and N4 exocyclic nitrogen of cytosine, respectively. Biochemical analyses indicate that the substrate preference of TET2 results from the different efficiencies of hydrogen abstraction in TET2-mediated oxidation. The restrained conformation of 5hmC and 5fC within the catalytic cavity may prevent their abstractable hydrogen(s) adopting a favourable orientation for hydrogen abstraction and thus result in low catalytic efficiency. Our studies demonstrate that the substrate preference of TET2 results from the intrinsic value of its substrates at their 5mC derivative groups and suggest that 5hmC is relatively stable and less prone to further oxidation by TET proteins. Therefore, TET proteins are evolutionarily tuned to be less reactive towards 5hmC and facilitate the generation of 5hmC as a potentially stable mark for regulatory functions.</p>

<h3><b>BioJazz: in silico evolution of cellular networks with unbounded complexity using rule-based modeling</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Feng, S., Ollivier, J. F., Swain, P. S., Soyer, O. S.<br>

<p>
<p>Systems biologists aim to decipher the structure and dynamics of signaling and regulatory networks underpinning cellular responses; synthetic biologists can use this insight to alter existing networks or engineer <I>de novo</I> ones. Both tasks will benefit from an understanding of which structural and dynamic features of networks can emerge from evolutionary processes, through which intermediary steps these arise, and whether they embody general design principles. As natural evolution at the level of network dynamics is difficult to study, <I>in silico</I> evolution of network models can provide important insights. However, current tools used for <I>in silico</I> evolution of network dynamics are limited to <I>ad hoc</I> computer simulations and models. Here we introduce BioJazz, an extendable, user-friendly tool for simulating the evolution of dynamic biochemical networks. Unlike previous tools for <I>in silico</I> evolution, BioJazz allows for the evolution of cellular networks with unbounded complexity by combining rule-based modeling with an encoding of networks that is akin to a genome. We show that BioJazz can be used to implement biologically realistic selective pressures and allows exploration of the space of network architectures and dynamics that implement prescribed physiological functions. BioJazz is provided as an open-source tool to facilitate its further development and use.

<h3><b>Efficient conditional knockout targeting vector construction using co-selection BAC recombineering (CoSBR)</b></h3>

<p>
<p>A simple and efficient strategy for Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) recombineering based on co-selection is described. We show that it is possible to efficiently modify two positions of a BAC simultaneously by co-transformation of a single-stranded DNA oligo and a double-stranded selection cassette. The use of co-selection BAC recombineering reduces the DNA manipulation needed to make a conditional knockout gene targeting vector to only two steps: a single round of BAC modification followed by a retrieval step.</p>

<p>Access to genome-wide data provides the opportunity to address questions concerning the ability of transcription factors (TFs) to assemble in distinct macromolecular complexes. Here, we introduce the PAnDA (Protein And DNA Associations) approach to characterize DNA associations with human TFs using expression profiles, protein&ndash;protein interactions and recognition motifs. Our method predicts TF binding events with &gt;0.80 accuracy revealing cell-specific regulatory patterns that can be exploited for future investigations. Even when the precise DNA-binding motifs of a specific TF are not available, the information derived from protein-protein networks is sufficient to perform high-confidence predictions (area under the ROC curve of 0.89). PAnDA is freely available at <A HREF="http://service.tartaglialab.com/new_submission/panda">http://service.tartaglialab.com/new_submission/panda</A>.</p>

<p>Elucidating the dynamic organization of nuclear RNA foci is important for understanding and manipulating these functional sites of gene expression in both physiological and pathological states. However, such studies have been difficult to establish <I>in vivo</I> as a result of the absence of suitable RNA imaging methods. Here, we describe a high-resolution fluorescence RNA imaging method, ECHO-liveFISH, to label endogenous nuclear RNA in living mice and chicks. Upon <I>in vivo</I> electroporation, exciton-controlled sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes revealed focally concentrated endogenous 28S rRNA and U3 snoRNA at nucleoli and poly(A) RNA at nuclear speckles. Time-lapse imaging reveals steady-state stability of these RNA foci and dynamic dissipation of 28S rRNA concentrations upon polymerase I inhibition in native brain tissue. Confirming the validity of this technique in a physiological context, the <I>in vivo</I> RNA labeling did not interfere with the function of target RNA nor cause noticeable cytotoxicity or perturbation of cellular behavior.</p>

<h3><b>Simultaneous live imaging of the transcription and nuclear position of specific genes</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Ochiai, H., Sugawara, T., Yamamoto, T.<br>
Date: 2015-10-30T02:05:30-07:00</p>
<p>
<p>The relationship between genome organization and gene expression has recently been established. However, the relationships between spatial organization, dynamics, and transcriptional regulation of the genome remain unknown. In this study, we developed a live-imaging method for simultaneous measurements of the transcriptional activity and nuclear position of endogenous genes, which we termed the &lsquo;Real-time Observation of Localization and EXpression (ROLEX)&rsquo; system. We demonstrated that ROLEX is highly specific and does not affect the expression level of the target gene. ROLEX enabled detection of sub-genome-wide mobility changes that depended on the state of <I>Nanog</I> transactivation in embryonic stem cells. We believe that the ROLEX system will become a powerful tool for exploring the relationship between transcription and nuclear dynamics in living cells.</p>

<p>
<p>Antisense and RNAi-related oligonucleotides have gained attention as laboratory tools and therapeutic agents based on their ability to manipulate biological events <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>. We show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> enrichment of medium (CEM) potentiates the <I>in vitro</I> activity of multiple types of oligonucleotides, independent of their net charge and modifications, in various cells. In addition, CEM reflects <I>in vivo</I> silencing activity more consistently than conventional transfection methods. Microscopic analysis reveals that CEM provides a subcellular localization pattern of oligonucleotides resembling that obtained by unassisted transfection, but with quantitative improvement. Highly monodispersed nanoparticles ~100 nm in size are found in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-enriched serum-containing medium regardless of the presence or absence of oligonucleotides. Transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that the 100-nm particles are in fact an ensemble of much smaller nanoparticles ( ~ 15 nm). The presence of these nanoparticles is critical for the efficient uptake of various oligonucleotides. In contrast, CEM is ineffective for plasmids, which are readily transfected via the conventional calcium phosphate method. Collectively, CEM enables a more accurate prediction of the systemic activity of therapeutic oligonucleotides, while enhancing the broad usability of oligonucleotides in the laboratory.</p>

<p>Histone post-translational modifications are key contributors to chromatin structure and function, and participate in the maintenance of genome stability. Understanding the establishment and maintenance of these marks, along with their misregulation in pathologies is thus a major focus in the field. While we have learned a great deal about the enzymes regulating histone modifications on nucleosomal histones, much less is known about the mechanisms establishing modifications on soluble newly synthesized histones. This includes methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9), a mark that primes the formation of heterochromatin, a critical chromatin landmark for genome stability. Here, we report that H3K9 mono- and dimethylation is imposed during translation by the methyltransferase SetDB1. We discuss the importance of these results in the context of heterochromatin establishment and maintenance and new therapeutic opportunities in pathologies where heterochromatin is perturbed.</p>

<p>
<p>We have recently shown that the incorporation of modified nucleotides such as 5-N-carboxamide-deoxyuridines into random nucleic acid libraries improves success rates in SELEX experiments and facilitates the identification of ligands with slow off-rates. Here we report the impact of these modifications on the thermodynamic stability of both duplexes and intramolecular &lsquo;single-stranded&rsquo; structures. Within duplexes, large, hydrophobic naphthyl groups were destabilizing relative to the all natural DNA duplex, while the hydrophilic groups exhibited somewhat improved duplex stability. All of the significant changes in stability were driven by opposing contributions from the enthalpic and entropic terms. In contrast, both benzyl and naphthyl modifications stabilized intramolecular single-stranded structures relative to their natural DNA analogs, consistent with the notion that intramolecular folding allows formation of novel, stabilizing hydrophobic interactions. Imino proton NMR data provided evidence that elements of the folded structure form at temperatures well below the T<SUB>m</SUB>, with a melting transition that is distinctly less cooperative when compared to duplex DNA. Although there are no data to suggest that the unmodified DNA sequences fold into structures similar to their modified analogs, this still represents clear evidence that these modifications impart thermodynamic stability to the folded structure not achievable with unmodified DNA.</p>

<p>
<p>The <I>in vivo</I> potency of antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) has been significantly increased by reducing their length to 8&ndash;15 nucleotides and by the incorporation of high affinity RNA binders such as 2', 4'-bridged nucleic acids (also known as locked nucleic acid or LNA, and 2',4'-constrained ethyl [cET]).&nbsp;We now report the development of a novel ASO design in which such short ASO monomers to one or more targets are co-synthesized as homo- or heterodimers or multimers via phosphodiester linkers that are stable in plasma, but cleaved inside cells, releasing the active ASO monomers. Compared to current ASOs, these multimers and multi-targeting oligonucleotides (MTOs) provide increased plasma protein binding and biodistribution to liver, and increased <I>in vivo</I> efficacy against single or multiple targets with a single construct. <I>In vivo</I>, MTOs synthesized in both RNase H-activating and steric-blocking oligonucleotide designs provide 4&ndash;5-fold increased potency and 2-fold increased efficacy, suggesting broad therapeutic applications.</p>

<h3><b>Base damage, local sequence context and TP53 mutation hotspots: a molecular dynamics study of benzo[a]pyrene induced DNA distortion and mutability</b></h3>

<p>
<p>The mutational pattern for the <I>TP53</I> tumour suppressor gene in lung tumours differs to other cancer types by having a higher frequency of G:C&gt;T:A transversions. The aetiology of this differing mutation pattern is still unknown. Benzo[a]pyrene,diol epoxide (BPDE) is a potent cigarette smoke carcinogen that forms guanine adducts at <I>TP53</I> CpG mutation hotspot sites including codons 157, 158, 245, 248 and 273. We performed molecular modelling of BPDE-adducted <I>TP53</I> duplex sequences to determine the degree of local distortion caused by adducts which could influence the ability of nucleotide excision repair. We show that BPDE adducted codon 157 has greater structural distortion than other <I>TP53</I> G:C&gt;T:A hotspot sites and that sequence context more distal to adjacent bases must influence local distortion. Using <I>TP53</I> trinucleotide mutation signatures for lung cancer in smokers and non-smokers we further show that codons 157 and 273 have the highest mutation probability in smokers. Combining this information with adduct structural data we predict that G:C&gt;T:A mutations at codon 157 in lung tumours of smokers are predominantly caused by BPDE. Our results provide insight into how different DNA sequence contexts show variability in DNA distortion at mutagen adduct sites that could compromise DNA repair at well characterized cancer related mutation hotspots.</p>

<h3><b>A structural approach reveals how neighbouring C2H2 zinc fingers influence DNA binding specificity</b></h3>

<p>
<p>Development of an accurate protein&ndash;DNA recognition code that can predict DNA specificity from protein sequence is a central problem in biology. C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB> zinc fingers constitute by far the largest family of DNA binding domains and their binding specificity has been studied intensively. However, despite decades of research, accurate prediction of DNA specificity remains elusive. A major obstacle is thought to be the inability of current methods to account for the influence of neighbouring domains. Here we show that this problem can be addressed using a structural approach: we build structural models for all C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>-ZF&ndash;DNA complexes with known binding motifs and find six distinct binding modes. Each mode changes the orientation of specificity residues with respect to the DNA, thereby modulating base preference. Most importantly, the structural analysis shows that residues at the domain interface strongly and predictably influence the binding mode, and hence specificity. Accounting for predicted binding mode significantly improves prediction accuracy of predicted motifs. This new insight into the fundamental behaviour of C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>-ZFs has implications for both improving the prediction of natural zinc finger-binding sites, and for prioritizing further experiments to complete the code. It also provides a new design feature for zinc finger engineering.</p>

<h3><b>Beyond the one-locus-one-miRNA paradigm: microRNA isoforms enable deeper insights into breast cancer heterogeneity</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Telonis, A. G., Loher, P., Jing, Y., Londin, E., Rigoutsos, I.<br>

<p>
<p>Here we describe our study of miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) in breast cancer (BRCA) and normal breast data sets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) repository. We report that the full isomiR profiles, from both known and novel human-specific miRNA loci, are particularly rich in information and can distinguish tumor from normal tissue&nbsp;much better than the archetype miRNAs. IsomiR expression is also dependent on the patient's race, exemplified by miR-183-5p, several isomiRs of which are upregulated in triple negative BRCA in white but not black women. Additionally, we find that an isomiR's 5' endpoint and length, but not the genomic origin, are key determinants of the regulation of its expression. Overexpression of distinct miR-183-5p isomiRs in MDA-MB-231 cells followed by microarray analysis revealed that each isomiR has a distinct impact on the cellular transcriptome. Parallel integrative analysis of mRNA expression from BRCA data sets of the TCGA repository demonstrated that isomiRs can distinguish between the luminal A and luminal B subtypes and explain in more depth the molecular differences between them than the archetype molecules. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that post-transcriptional studies of BRCA will benefit from transcending the one-locus-one-miRNA paradigm and taking into account all isoforms from each miRNA locus&nbsp;as well as the patient's race.</p>

<h3><b>Searching target sites on DNA by proteins: Role of DNA dynamics under confinement</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Mondal, A., Bhattacherjee, A.<br>
Date: 2015-10-30T02:05:29-07:00</p>
<p>
<p>DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) rapidly search and specifically bind to their target sites on genomic DNA in order to trigger many cellular regulatory processes. It has been suggested that the facilitation of search dynamics is achieved by combining 3D diffusion with one-dimensional sliding and hopping dynamics of interacting proteins. Although, recent studies have advanced the knowledge of molecular determinants that affect one-dimensional search efficiency, the role of DNA molecule is poorly understood. In this study, by using coarse-grained simulations, we propose that dynamics of DNA molecule and its degree of confinement due to cellular crowding concertedly regulate its groove geometry and modulate the inter-communication with DBPs. Under weak confinement, DNA dynamics promotes many short, rotation-decoupled sliding events interspersed by hopping dynamics. While this results in faster 1D diffusion, associated probability of missing targets by jumping over them increases. In contrast, strong confinement favours rotation-coupled sliding to locate targets but lacks structural flexibility to achieve desired specificity. By testing under physiological crowding, our study provides a plausible mechanism on how DNA molecule may help in maintaining an optimal balance between fast hopping and rotation-coupled sliding dynamics, to locate target sites rapidly and form specific complexes precisely.</p>

<h3><b>Joint modeling of RNase footprint sequencing profiles for genome-wide inference of RNA structure</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Zou, C., Ouyang, Z.<br>

<p>
<p>Recent studies have revealed significant roles of RNA structure in almost every step of RNA processing, including transcription, splicing, transport and translation. RNase footprint sequencing (RNase-seq) has emerged to dissect RNA structures at the genome scale. However, it remains challenging to analyze RNase-seq data because of the issues of signal sparsity, variability and correlations among various RNases. We present a probabilistic framework, joint Poisson-gamma mixture (JPGM), for integrative modeling of multiple RNase-seq profiles. Combining JPGM with hidden Markov model allows genome-wide inference of RNA structures. We apply the joint modeling approach for inferring base pairing states on simulated data sets and RNase-seq profiles of the double-strand specific RNase V1 and single-strand specific RNase S1 in yeast. We demonstrate that joint analysis of V1 and S1 profiles outputs interpretable RNA structure states, while approaches that analyze each profile separately do not. The joint modeling approach predicts the structure states of all nucleotides in 3196 transcripts of yeast without compromising accuracy, while the simple thresholding approach misses 43% of the nucleotides. Furthermore, the posterior probabilities outputted by our model are able to resolve the structural ambiguity of 300 000 nucleotides with overlapping V1 and S1 cleavage sites. Our model also generates RNA accessibilities, which are associated with three-dimensional conformations.</p>

<h3><b>Global identification of the genetic networks and cis-regulatory elements of the cold response in zebrafish</b></h3>

<p>
<p>The transcriptional programs of ectothermic teleosts are directly influenced by water temperature. However, the <I>cis</I>- and <I>trans</I>-factors governing cold responses are not well characterized. We profiled transcriptional changes in eight zebrafish tissues exposed to mildly and severely cold temperatures using RNA-Seq. A total of 1943 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, from which 34 clusters representing distinct tissue and temperature response expression patterns were derived using the <I>k</I>-means fuzzy clustering algorithm. The promoter regions of the clustered DEGs that demonstrated strong co-regulation were analysed for enriched <I>cis</I>-regulatory elements with a motif discovery program, DREME. Seventeen motifs, ten known and seven novel, were identified, which covered 23% of the DEGs. Two motifs predicted to be the binding sites for the transcription factors Bcl6 and Jun, respectively, were chosen for experimental verification, and they demonstrated the expected cold-induced and cold-repressed patterns of gene regulation. Protein interaction modeling of the network components followed by experimental validation suggested that Jun physically interacts with Bcl6 and might be a hub factor that orchestrates the cold response in zebrafish. Thus, the methodology used and the regulatory networks uncovered in this study provide a foundation for exploring the mechanisms of cold adaptation in teleosts.</p>

<p>Mediator is a large multiprotein complex conserved in all eukaryotes, which has a crucial coregulator function in transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). However, the molecular mechanisms of its action <I>in vivo</I> remain to be understood. Med17 is an essential and central component of the Mediator head module. In this work, we utilised our large collection of conditional temperature-sensitive <I>med17</I> mutants to investigate Mediator's role in coordinating preinitiation complex (PIC) formation <I>in vivo</I> at the genome level after a transfer to a non-permissive temperature for 45 minutes. The effect of a yeast mutation proposed to be equivalent to the human Med17-L371P responsible for infantile cerebral atrophy was also analyzed. The ChIP-seq results demonstrate that <I>med17</I> mutations differentially affected the global presence of several PIC components including Mediator, TBP, TFIIH modules and Pol II. Our data show that Mediator stabilizes TFIIK kinase and TFIIH core modules independently, suggesting that the recruitment or the stability of TFIIH modules is regulated independently on yeast genome. We demonstrate that Mediator selectively contributes to TBP recruitment or stabilization to chromatin. This study provides an extensive genome-wide view of Mediator's role in PIC formation, suggesting that Mediator coordinates multiple steps of a PIC assembly pathway.</p>

<h3><b>A bacterial regulatory RNA attenuates virulence, spread and human host cell phagocytosis</b></h3>

<p>
<p><I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> pathogenesis is directed by regulatory proteins and RNAs. We report the case of an RNA attenuating virulence and host uptake, possibly to sustain commensalism. A <I>S. aureus</I> sRNA, SprC (srn_3610), reduced virulence and bacterial loads in a mouse infection model. <I>S. aureus</I> deleted for <I>sprC</I> became more virulent and increased bacterial dissemination in colonized animals. Conversely, inducing SprC expression lowered virulence and the bacterial load. Without <I>sprC, S. aureus</I> phagocytosis by monocytes and macrophages was higher, whereas bacteria were internalized at lower yields when SprC expression was stimulated. Without <I>sprC</I>, higher internalization led to a greater number of extracellular bacteria, facilitating colonization. SprC expression decreased after phagocytosis, concurring with the facilitated growth of bacteria lacking the sRNA in the presence of an oxidant. The major staphylococcal autolysin facilitates <I>S. aureus</I> uptake by human phagocytes. ATL proved to be negatively regulated by SprC. The SprC domains involved in pairing with <I>atl</I> mRNA were analyzed. The addition of ATL reduced phagocytosis of bacteria lacking <I>sprC</I> with no effects on wild-type bacterial uptake, implying that SprC influences phagocytosis, at least in part, by controlling ATL. Since the control of SprC on ATL was modest, other factors must contribute to <I>atl</I> regulation.</p>

<p>The  gene is encoded in broad-host range and low-copy plasmids. It is genetically linked to antibiotic resistance genes of the major human pathogens of phylum Firmicutes. The homodimeric forms of  (<SUB>2</SUB>) coordinate the plasmid copy number control, faithful partition (<SUB>2</SUB> and <SUB>2</SUB>) and better-than-random segregation (<SUB>2</SUB>) systems. The promoter (<I>P</I>) of the  operon (<I>P</I><SUB></SUB>) transiently interacts with <SUB>2</SUB>. Adding <SUB>2</SUB> facilitates the formation of stable <SUB>2</SUB>&middot;<I>P</I><SUB></SUB> complexes. Here we show that limiting <SUB>2</SUB> interacts with the N-terminal domain of the &beta;&rsquo; subunit of the <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> RNA polymerase (RNAP-<sup>A</sup>) vegetative holoenzyme. In this way <SUB>2</SUB> recruits RNAP-<sup>A</sup> onto <I>P</I><SUB></SUB> DNA. Partial <I>P</I><SUB></SUB> occupancy by <SUB>2</SUB> increases the rate at which RNAP-<sup>A</sup> complex shifts from its closed (RP<SUB>C</SUB>) to open (RP<SUB>O</SUB>) form. This shift increases transcription activation. Adding <SUB>2</SUB> further increases the rate of <I>P</I><SUB></SUB> transcription initiation, perhaps by stabilizing the <SUB>2</SUB><I>&middot;P</I><SUB></SUB> complex. In contrast, full operator occupancy by <SUB>2</SUB> facilitates RP<SUB>C</SUB> formation, but it blocks RP<SUB>O</SUB> isomerization and represses <I>P</I><SUB></SUB> utilization. The stimulation and inhibition of RP<SUB>O</SUB> formation is the mechanism whereby <SUB>2</SUB> mediates copy number fluctuation and stable plasmid segregation. By this mechanism, <SUB>2</SUB> also indirectly influences the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes.</p>

<h3><b>Regulation of DNA replication at the end of the mitochondrial D-loop involves the helicase TWINKLE and a conserved sequence element</b></h3>

<p>
<p>The majority of mitochondrial DNA replication events are terminated prematurely. The nascent DNA remains stably associated with the template, forming a triple-stranded displacement loop (D-loop) structure. However, the function of the D-loop region of the mitochondrial genome remains poorly understood. Using a comparative genomics approach we here identify two closely related 15 nt sequence motifs of the D-loop, strongly conserved among vertebrates. One motif is at the D-loop 5'-end and is part of the conserved sequence block 1 (CSB1). The other motif, here denoted coreTAS, is at the D-loop 3'-end. Both these sequences may prevent transcription across the D-loop region, since light and heavy strand transcription is terminated at CSB1 and coreTAS, respectively. Interestingly, the replication of the nascent D-loop strand, occurring in a direction opposite to that of heavy strand transcription, is also terminated at coreTAS, suggesting that coreTAS is involved in termination of both transcription and replication. Finally, we demonstrate that the loading of the helicase TWINKLE at coreTAS is reversible, implying that this site is a crucial component of a switch between D-loop formation and full-length mitochondrial DNA replication.</p>

<p>
<p>Combining biophysical measurements on T4 bacteriophage replication complexes with detailed structural information can illuminate the molecular mechanisms of these &lsquo;macromolecular machines&rsquo;. Here we use the low energy circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescent properties of site-specifically introduced base analogues to map and quantify the equilibrium binding interactions of short (8 nts) ssDNA oligomers with gp32 monomers at single nucleotide resolution. We show that single gp32 molecules interact most directly and specifically near the 3'-end of these ssDNA oligomers, thus defining the polarity of gp32 binding with respect to the ssDNA lattice, and that only 2&ndash;3 nts are directly involved in this tight binding interaction. The loss of exciton coupling in the CD spectra of dimer 2-AP (2-aminopurine) probes at various positions in the ssDNA constructs, together with increases in fluorescence intensity, suggest that gp32 binding directly extends the sugar-phosphate backbone of this ssDNA oligomer, particularly at the 3'-end and facilitates base unstacking along the entire 8-mer lattice. These results provide a model (and &lsquo;DNA map&rsquo;) for the isolated gp32 binding to ssDNA targets, which serves as the nucleation step for the cooperative binding that occurs at transiently exposed ssDNA sequences within the functioning T4 DNA replication complex.</p>

<p>
<p>We here use our site-specific base analog mapping approach to study the interactions and binding equilibria of cooperatively-bound clusters of the single-stranded DNA binding protein (gp32) of the T4 DNA replication complex with longer ssDNA (and dsDNA) lattices. We show that in cooperatively bound clusters the binding free energy appears to be equi-partitioned between the gp32 monomers of the cluster, so that all bind to the ssDNA lattice with comparable affinity, but also that the outer domains of the gp32 monomers at the ends of the cluster can fluctuate on and off the lattice and that the clusters of gp32 monomers can slide along the ssDNA. We also show that at very low binding densities gp32 monomers bind to the ssDNA lattice at random, but that cooperatively bound gp32 clusters bind preferentially at the 5'-end of the ssDNA lattice. We use these results and the gp32 monomer-binding results of the companion paper to propose a detailed model for how gp32 might bind to and interact with ssDNA lattices in its various binding modes, and also consider how these clusters might interact with other components of the T4 DNA replication complex.</p>

<h3><b>Topoisomerase 1-dependent deletions initiated by incision at ribonucleotides are biased to the non-transcribed strand of a highly activated reporter</b></h3>

<p>
<p>DNA polymerases incorporate ribonucleoside monophosphates (rNMPs) into genomic DNA at a low level and such rNMPs are efficiently removed in an error-free manner by ribonuclease (RNase) H2. In the absence of RNase H2 in budding yeast, persistent rNMPs give rise to short deletions via a mutagenic process initiated by Topoisomerase 1 (Top1). We examined the activity of a 2-bp, rNMP-dependent deletion hotspot [the (TG)<SUB>2</SUB> hotspot] when on the transcribed or non-transcribed strand (TS or NTS, respectively) of a reporter placed in both orientations near a strong origin of replication. Under low-transcription conditions, hotspot activity depended on whether the (TG)<SUB>2</SUB> sequence was part of the newly synthesized leading or lagging strand of replication. In agreement with an earlier study, deletions occurred at a much higher rate when (TG)<SUB>2</SUB> was on the nascent leading strand. Under high-transcription conditions, however, hotspot activity was not dependent on replication direction, but rather on whether the (TG)<SUB>2</SUB> sequence was on the TS or NTS of the reporter. Deletion rates were several orders of magnitude higher when (TG)<SUB>2</SUB> was on the NTS. These results highlight the complex interplay between replication and transcription in regulating Top1-dependent genetic instability.</p>

<p>
<p>Olfactory receptor (<I>Olfr</I>) genes comprise the largest gene family in mice. Despite their importance in olfaction, how most <I>Olfr</I> mRNAs are regulated remains unexplored. Using RNA-seq analysis coupled with analysis of pre-existing databases, we found that <I>Olfr</I> mRNAs have several atypical features suggesting that post-transcriptional regulation impacts their expression. First, <I>Olfr</I> mRNAs, as a group, have dramatically higher average AU-content and lower predicted secondary structure than do control mRNAs. Second, <I>Olfr</I> mRNAs have a higher density of AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3'UTR and upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5 UTR than do control mRNAs. Third, <I>Olfr</I> mRNAs have shorter 3' UTR regions and with fewer predicted miRNA-binding sites. All of these novel properties correlated with higher <I>Olfr</I> expression. We also identified striking differences in the post-transcriptional features of the mRNAs from the two major classes of <I>Olfr</I> genes, a finding consistent with their independent evolutionary origin. Together, our results suggest that the <I>Olfr</I> gene family has encountered unusual selective forces in neural cells that have driven them to acquire unique post-transcriptional regulatory features. In support of this possibility, we found that while <I>Olfr</I> mRNAs are degraded by a deadenylation-dependent mechanism, they are largely protected from this decay in neural lineage cells.</p>

<p>To gain insight into the pathogenesis of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and whether there is progression from normal-to-adenoma-to-carcinoma, we performed genome-wide gene expression, gene methylation, microRNA expression and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis in human adrenocortical tissue (normal, adrenocortical adenomas and ACC) samples. A pairwise comparison of normal, adrenocortical adenomas and ACC gene expression profiles with more than four-fold expression differences and an adjusted <I>P</I>-value &lt; 0.05 revealed no major differences in normal versus adrenocortical adenoma whereas there are 808 and 1085, respectively, dysregulated genes between ACC versus adrenocortical adenoma and ACC versus normal. The majority of the dysregulated genes in ACC were downregulated. By integrating the CGH, gene methylation and expression profiles of potential miRNAs with the gene expression of dysregulated genes, we found that there are higher alterations in ACC versus normal compared to ACC versus adrenocortical adenoma. Importantly, we identified several novel molecular pathways that are associated with dysregulated genes and further experimentally validated that oncostatin m signaling induces caspase 3 dependent apoptosis and suppresses cell proliferation. Finally, we propose that there is higher number of genomic changes from normal-to-adenoma-to-carcinoma and identified oncostatin m signaling as a plausible druggable pathway for therapeutics.</p>

<p>The human APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B genes (A3A and A3B) encode DNA mutator enzymes that deaminate cytidine and 5-methylcytidine residues in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). They are important sources of mutations in many cancer genomes which show a preponderance of CG-&gt;TA transitions. Although both enzymes can hypermutate chromosomal DNA in an experimental setting, only A3A can induce double strand DNA breaks, even though the catalytic domains of A3B and A3A differ by only 9% at the protein level. Accordingly we sought the molecular basis underlying A3B attenuation through the generation of A3A-A3B chimeras and mutants. It transpires that the N-terminal domain facilitates A3B activity while a handful of substitutions in the catalytic C-terminal domain impacting ssDNA binding serve to attenuate A3B compared to A3A. Interestingly, functional attenuation is also observed for the rhesus monkey rhA3B enzyme compared to rhA3A indicating that this genotoxic dichotomy has been selected for and maintained for some 38 million years. Expression of all human ssDNA cytidine deaminase genes is absent in mature sperm indicating they contribute to somatic mutation and cancer but not human diversity.</p>

<p>
<p>Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are known to trigger mRNA degradation in the nucleus via an RNase H-dependent mechanism. We have now identified a putative cytoplasmic mechanism through which ASO gapmers silence their targets when transfected or delivered gymnotically (i.e. in the absence of any transfection reagent). We have shown that the ASO gapmers can interact with the Ago-2 PAZ domain and can localize into GW-182 mRNA-degradation bodies (GW-bodies). The degradation products of the targeted mRNA, however, are not generated by Ago-2-directed cleavage. The apparent identification of a cytoplasmic pathway complements the previously known nuclear activity of ASOs and concurrently suggests that nuclear localization is not an absolute requirement for gene silencing.</p>

<p>Co-infection with HIV-1 and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the cause of aggressive AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (AIDS-KS) characterized by abnormal angiogenesis. The impact of HIV-1 and KSHV interaction on the pathogenesis and extensive angiogenesis of AIDS-KS remains unclear. Here, we explored the synergistic effect of HIV-1 Tat and KSHV oncogene Orf-K1 on angiogenesis. Our results showed that soluble Tat or ectopic expression of Tat enhanced K1-induced cell proliferation, microtubule formation and angiogenesis in chorioallantoic membrane and nude mice models. Mechanistic studies revealed that Tat promoted K1-induced angiogenesis by enhancing NF-B signaling. Mechanistically, we showed that Tat synergized with K1 to induce the expression of miR-891a-5p, which directly targeted IB&alpha; 3' untranslated region, leading to NF-B activation. Consequently, inhibition of miR-891a-5p increased IB&alpha; level, prevented nuclear translocation of NF-B p65 and ultimately suppressed the synergistic effect of Tat- and K1-induced angiogenesis. Our results illustrate that, by targeting IB&alpha; to activate the NF-B pathway, miR-891a-5p mediates Tat and K1 synergistic induction of angiogenesis. Therefore, the miR-891a-5p/NF-B pathway is important in the pathogenesis of AIDS-KS, which could be an attractive therapeutic target for AIDS-KS.</p>

<p>
<p>CRISPR is a genome-editing platform that makes use of the bacterially-derived endonuclease Cas9 to introduce DNA double-strand breaks at precise locations in the genome using complementary guide RNAs. We developed a nuclear domain knock-in screen, whereby the insertion of a gene encoding the green fluorescent protein variant Clover is inserted by Cas9-mediated homology directed repair (HDR) within the first exon of genes that are required for the structural integrity of subnuclear domains such as the nuclear lamina and promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs). Using this approach, we compared strategies for enhancing CRISPR-mediated HDR, focusing on known genes and small molecules that impact non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). Ultimately, we identified the small molecule RS-1 as a potent enhancer of CRISPR-based genome editing, enhancing HDR 3- to 6-fold depending on the locus and transfection method. We also characterized U2OS human osteosarcoma cells expressing Clover-tagged PML and demonstrate that this strategy generates cell lines with PML NBs that are structurally and functionally similar to bodies in the parental cell line. Thus, the nuclear domain knock-in screen that we describe provides a simple means of rapidly evaluating methods and small molecules that have the potential to enhance Cas9-mediated HDR.</p>

<p>
<p>Non-selenocysteine-containing phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (NPGPx or GPx7) is an oxidative stress sensor that modulates the antioxidative activity of its target proteins through intermolecular disulfide bond formation. Given NPGPx's role in protecting cells from oxidative damage, identification of the oxidative stress-induced protein complexes, which forms with key stress factors, may offer novel insight into intracellular reactive oxygen species homeostasis. Here, we show that NPGPx forms a disulfide bond with the translational regulator cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 2 (CPEB2) that results in negative regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1&alpha;) RNA translation. In NPGPx-proficient cells, high oxidative stress that disrupts this bonding compromises the association of CPEB2 with HIF-1&alpha; RNA, leading to elevated HIF-1&alpha; RNA translation. NPGPx-deficient cells, in contrast, demonstrate increased HIF-1&alpha; RNA translation under normoxia with both impaired induction of HIF-1&alpha; synthesis and blunted HIF-1&alpha;-programmed transcription following oxidative stress. Together, these results reveal a molecular mechanism for how NPGPx mediates CPEB2-controlled HIF-1&alpha; RNA translation in a redox-sensitive manner.</p>

<h3><b>The novel influenza A virus protein PA-X and its naturally deleted variant show different enzymatic properties in comparison to the viral endonuclease PA</b></h3>

<p>
<p>The PA protein of Influenza A virus (IAV) encoded by segment 3 acts as a specialized RNA endonuclease in the transcription of the viral genome. The same genomic segment encodes for a second shorter protein, termed PA-X, with the first 191 N-terminal aminoacids (aa) identical to PA, but with a completely different C-ter domain of 61 aa, due to a ribosomal frameshifting. In addition, it has been shown that several IAV isolates encode for a naturally truncated PA-X variant, PAXC20, missing the last 20 aa. The biochemical properties of PA-X and PAXC20 have been poorly investigated so far. Here, we have carried out an enzymatic characterization of PA-X and its naturally deleted form, in comparison with PA from the human IAV strain A/WSN/33 (H1N1). Our results showed, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, that PA-X possesses an endonucleolytic activity. Both PA and PA-X preferentially cut single stranded RNA regions, but with some differences. In addition, we showed that PAXC20 has severely reduced nuclease activity. These results point to a previously undetected role of the last C-ter 20 aa for the catalytic activity of PA-X and support distinct roles for these proteins in the viral life cycle.</p>

<h3><b>Slicer-independent mechanism drives small-RNA strand separation during human RISC assembly</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Park, J. H., Shin, C.<br>

<p>
<p>Small RNA silencing is mediated by the effector RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that consists of an Argonaute protein (AGOs 1&ndash;4 in humans). A fundamental step during RISC assembly involves the separation of two strands of a small RNA duplex, whereby only the guide strand is retained to form the mature RISC, a process not well understood. Despite the widely accepted view that &lsquo;slicer-dependent unwinding&rsquo; via passenger-strand cleavage is a prerequisite for the assembly of a highly complementary siRNA into the AGO2-RISC, here we show by careful re-examination that &lsquo;slicer-independent unwinding&rsquo; plays a more significant role in human RISC maturation than previously appreciated, not only for a miRNA duplex, but, unexpectedly, for a highly complementary siRNA as well. We discovered that &lsquo;slicer-dependency&rsquo; for the unwinding was affected primarily by certain parameters such as temperature and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. We further validate these observations in non-slicer AGOs (1, 3 and 4) that can be programmed with siRNAs at the physiological temperature of humans, suggesting that slicer-independent mechanism is likely a common feature of human AGOs. Our results now clearly explain why both miRNA and siRNA are found in all four human AGOs, which is in striking contrast to the strict small-RNA sorting system in <I>Drosophila</I>.</p>

<h3><b>RNA binding to APOBEC3G induces the disassembly of functional deaminase complexes by displacing single-stranded DNA substrates</b></h3>

<p>
<p>APOBEC3G (A3G) DNA deaminase activity requires a holoenzyme complex whose assembly on nascent viral reverse transcripts initiates with A3G dimers binding to ssDNA followed by formation of higher-order A3G homo oligomers. Catalytic activity is inhibited when A3G binds to RNA. Our prior studies suggested that RNA inhibited A3G binding to ssDNA. In this report, near equilibrium binding and gel shift analyses showed that A3G assembly and disassembly on ssDNA was an ordered process involving A3G dimers and multimers thereof. Although, fluorescence anisotropy showed that A3G had similar nanomolar affinity for RNA and ssDNA, RNA stochastically dissociated A3G dimers and higher-order oligomers from ssDNA, suggesting a different modality for RNA binding. Mass spectrometry mapping of A3G peptides cross-linked to nucleic acid suggested ssDNA only bound to three peptides, amino acids (aa) 181&ndash;194 in the N-terminus and aa 314&ndash;320 and 345&ndash;374 in the C-terminus that were part of a continuous exposed surface. RNA bound to these peptides and uniquely associated with three additional peptides in the N- terminus, aa 15&ndash;29, 41&ndash;52 and 83&ndash;99, that formed a continuous surface area adjacent to the ssDNA binding surface. The data predict a mechanistic model of RNA inhibition of ssDNA binding to A3G in which competitive and allosteric interactions determine RNA-bound versus ssDNA-bound conformational states.</p>

<p>In tRNA, dihydrouridine is a conserved modified base generated by the post-transcriptional reduction of uridine. Formation of dihydrouridine 20, located in the D-loop, is catalyzed by dihydrouridine synthase 2 (Dus2). Human Dus2 (HsDus2) expression is upregulated in lung cancers, offering a growth advantage throughout its ability to interact with components of the translation apparatus and inhibit apoptosis. Here, we report the crystal structure of the individual domains of HsDus2 and their functional characterization. HsDus2 is organized into three major modules. The N-terminal catalytic domain contains the flavin cofactor involved in the reduction of uridine. The second module is the conserved &alpha;-helical domain known as the tRNA binding domain in HsDus2 homologues. It is connected via a flexible linker to an unusual extended version of a dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD). Enzymatic assays and yeast complementation showed that the catalytic domain binds selectively NADPH but cannot reduce uridine in the absence of the dsRBD. While in Dus enzymes from bacteria, plants and fungi, tRNA binding is essentially achieved by the &alpha;-helical domain, we showed that in HsDus2 this function is carried out by the dsRBD. This is the first reported case of a tRNA-modifying enzyme carrying a dsRBD used to bind tRNAs.</p>

<p>
<p>Translation is tightly regulated in cells for keeping adequate protein levels, this task being notably accomplished by dedicated mRNA-binding proteins recognizing a specific set of mRNAs to repress or facilitate their translation. To select specific mRNAs, mRNA-binding proteins can strongly bind to specific mRNA sequences/structures. However, many mRNA-binding proteins rather display a weak specificity to short and redundant sequences. Here we examined an alternative mechanism by which mRNA-binding proteins could inhibit the translation of specific mRNAs, using YB-1, a major translation regulator, as a case study. Based on a cooperative binding, YB-1 forms stable homo-multimers on some mRNAs while avoiding other mRNAs. Via such inhomogeneous distribution, YB-1 can selectively inhibit translation of mRNAs on which it has formed stable multimers. This novel mechanistic view on mRNA selection may be shared by other proteins considering the elevated occurrence of multimerization among mRNA-binding proteins. Interestingly, we also demonstrate how, by using the same mechanism, YB-1 can form multimers on specific DNA structures, which could provide novel insights into YB-1 nuclear functions in DNA repair and multi-drug resistance.</p>

<p>To address many challenges in RNA structure/function prediction, the characterization of RNA's modular architectural units is required. Using the RNA-As-Graphs (RAG) database, we have previously explored the existence of secondary structure (2D) submotifs within larger RNA structures. Here we present RAG-3D&mdash;a dataset of RNA tertiary (3D) structures and substructures plus a web-based search tool&mdash;designed to exploit graph representations of RNAs for the goal of searching for similar 3D structural fragments. The objects in RAG-3D consist of 3D structures translated into 3D graphs, cataloged based on the connectivity between their secondary structure elements. Each graph is additionally described in terms of its subgraph building blocks. The RAG-3D search tool then compares a query RNA 3D structure to those in the database to obtain structurally similar structures and substructures. This comparison reveals conserved 3D RNA features and thus may suggest functional connections. Though RNA search programs based on similarity in sequence, 2D, and/or 3D structural elements are available, our graph-based search tool may be advantageous for illuminating similarities that are not obvious; using motifs rather than sequence space also reduces search times considerably. Ultimately, such substructuring could be useful for RNA 3D structure prediction, structure/function inference and inverse folding.</p>

<p>In <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I>, 11 out of 42 tRNA species contain 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U), 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine (mcm<sup>5</sup>U), 5-carbamoylmethyluridine (ncm<sup>5</sup>U) or 5-carbamoylmethyl-2'-O-methyluridine (ncm<sup>5</sup>Um) nucleosides in the anticodon at the wobble position (U<SUB>34</SUB>). Earlier we showed that mutants unable to form the side chain at position 5 (ncm<sup>5</sup> or mcm<sup>5</sup>) or lacking sulphur at position 2 (s<sup>2</sup>) of U<SUB>34</SUB> result in pleiotropic phenotypes, which are all suppressed by overexpression of hypomodified tRNAs. This observation suggests that the observed phenotypes are due to inefficient reading of cognate codons or an increased frameshifting. The latter may be caused by a ternary complex (aminoacyl-tRNA*eEF1A*GTP) with a modification deficient tRNA inefficiently being accepted to the ribosomal A-site and thereby allowing an increased peptidyl-tRNA slippage and thus a frameshift error. In this study, we have investigated the role of wobble uridine modifications in reading frame maintenance, using either the <I>Renilla</I>/<I>Firefly</I> luciferase bicistronic reporter system or a modified Ty1 frameshifting site in a <I>HIS4A::lacZ</I> reporter system. We here show that the presence of mcm<sup>5</sup> and s<sup>2</sup> side groups at wobble uridines are important for reading frame maintenance and thus the aforementioned mutant phenotypes might partly be due to frameshift errors.</p>

<p>The fundamental role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of gene expression has been well-established, but many miRNA-driven regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. In the present study, we demonstrate that miRNAs regulate the expression of <I>DMPK</I>, the gene mutated in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), and we provide insight regarding the concerted effect of the miRNAs on the DMPK target. Specifically, we examined the binding of several miRNAs to the DMPK 3' UTR using luciferase assays. We validated the interactions between the DMPK transcript and the conserved miR-206 and miR-148a. We suggest a possible cooperativity between these two miRNAs and discuss gene targeting by miRNA pairs that vary in distance between their binding sites and expression profiles. In the same luciferase reporter system, we showed miR-15b/16 binding to the non-conserved CUG repeat tract present in the DMPK transcript and that the CUG-repeat-binding miRNAs might also act cooperatively. Moreover, we detected miR-16 in cytoplasmic foci formed by exogenously expressed RNAs with expanded CUG repeats. Therefore, we propose that the expanded CUGs may serve as a target for concerted regulation by miRNAs and may also act as molecular sponges for natural miRNAs with CAG repeats in their seed regions, thereby affecting their physiological functions.</p>

<p>
<p>The G-protein EF-Tu, which undergoes a major conformational change when EF-Tu&middot;GTP is converted to EF-Tu&middot;GDP, forms part of an aminoacyl(aa)-tRNA&middot;EF-Tu&middot;GTP ternary complex (TC) that accelerates the binding of aa-tRNA to the ribosome during peptide elongation. Such binding, placing a portion of EF-Tu in contact with the GTPase Associated Center (GAC), is followed by GTP hydrolysis and P<SUB>i</SUB> release, and results in formation of a pretranslocation (PRE) complex. Although tRNA movement through the ribosome during PRE complex formation has been extensively studied, comparatively little is known about the dynamics of EF-Tu interaction with either the ribosome or aa-tRNA. Here we examine these dynamics, utilizing ensemble and single molecule assays employing fluorescent labeled derivatives of EF-Tu, tRNA, and the ribosome to measure changes in either FRET efficiency or fluorescence intensity during PRE complex formation. Our results indicate that ribosome-bound EF-Tu separates from the GAC prior to its full separation from aa-tRNA, and suggest that EF-Tu&middot;GDP dissociates from the ribosome by two different pathways. These pathways correspond to either reversible EF-Tu&middot;GDP dissociation from the ribosome prior to the major conformational change in EF-Tu that follows GTP hydrolysis, or irreversible dissociation after or concomitant with this conformational change.</p>

<p>Genes encoding toxin&ndash;antitoxin (TA) systems are near ubiquitous in bacterial genomes and they play key roles in important aspects of bacterial physiology, including genomic stability, formation of persister cells under antibiotic stress, and resistance to phage infection. The CptIN locus from <I>Eubacterium rectale</I> is a member of the recently-discovered Type III class of TA systems, defined by a protein toxin suppressed by direct interaction with a structured RNA antitoxin. Here, we present the crystal structure of the CptIN protein&ndash;RNA complex to 2.2 &Aring; resolution. The structure reveals a new heterotetrameric quaternary organization for the Type III TA class, and the RNA antitoxin bears a novel structural feature of an extended A-twist motif within the pseudoknot fold. The retention of a conserved ribonuclease active site as well as traits normally associated with TA systems, such as plasmid maintenance, implicates a wider functional role for Type III TA systems. We present evidence for the co-variation of the Type III component pair, highlighting a distinctive evolutionary process in which an enzyme and its substrate co-evolve.</p>

<h3><b>Thymine DNA glycosylase exhibits negligible affinity for nucleobases that it removes from DNA</b></h3>

<p>Thymine DNA Glycosylase (TDG) performs essential functions in maintaining genetic integrity and epigenetic regulation. Initiating base excision repair, TDG removes thymine from mutagenic G<b>&middot;</b>T mispairs caused by 5-methylcytosine (mC) deamination and other lesions including uracil (U) and 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU). In DNA demethylation, TDG excises 5-formylcytosine (fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (caC), which are generated from mC by Tet (ten&ndash;eleven translocation) enzymes. Using improved crystallization conditions, we solved high-resolution (up to 1.45 &Aring;) structures of TDG enzyme&ndash;product complexes generated from substrates including G&middot;U, G&middot;T, G&middot;hmU, G&middot;fC and G&middot;caC. The structures reveal many new features, including key water-mediated enzyme&ndash;substrate interactions. Together with nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, the structures demonstrate that TDG releases the excised base from its tight product complex with abasic DNA, contrary to previous reports. Moreover, DNA-free TDG exhibits no significant binding to free nucleobases (U, T, hmU), indicating a <I>K</I><SUB>d</SUB> &gt;&gt; 10 mM. The structures reveal a solvent-filled channel to the active site, which might facilitate dissociation of the excised base and enable caC excision, which involves solvent-mediated acid catalysis. Dissociation of the excised base allows TDG to bind the beta rather than the alpha anomer of the abasic sugar, which might stabilize the enzyme&ndash;product complex.</p>

<h3><b>MCM ring hexamerization is a prerequisite for DNA-binding</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Froelich, C. A., Nourse, A., Enemark, E. J.<br>
Date: 2015-10-30T02:05:30-07:00</p>
<p>
<p>The hexameric Minichromosome Maintenance (MCM) protein complex forms a ring that unwinds DNA at the replication fork in eukaryotes and archaea. Our recent crystal structure of an archaeal MCM N-terminal domain bound to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) revealed ssDNA associating across tight subunit interfaces but not at the loose interfaces, indicating that DNA-binding is governed not only by the DNA-binding residues of the subunits (MCM ssDNA-binding motif, MSSB) but also by the relative orientation of the subunits. We now extend these findings by showing that DNA-binding by the MCM N-terminal domain of the archaeal organism <I>Pyrococcus furiosus</I> occurs specifically in the hexameric oligomeric form. We show that mutants defective for hexamerization are defective in binding ssDNA despite retaining all the residues observed to interact with ssDNA in the crystal structure. One mutation that exhibits severely defective hexamerization and ssDNA-binding is at a conserved phenylalanine that aligns with the mouse <I>Mcm4(Chaos3)</I> mutation associated with chromosomal instability, cancer, and decreased intersubunit association.</p>

<h3><b>Systematic reconstruction of binding and stability landscapes of the fluorogenic aptamer spinach</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Ketterer, S., Fuchs, D., Weber, W., Meier, M.<br>

<p>
<p>Fluorogenic RNAs that are based on the complex formed by 3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI) derivatives and the RNA aptamer named Spinach were used to engineer a new generation of <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> sensors for bioanalytics. With the resolved crystal structure of the RNA/small molecule complex, the engineering map becomes available, but comprehensive information regarding the thermodynamic profile of the molecule is missing. Here, we reconstructed the full thermodynamic binding and stability landscapes between DFHBI and a truncated sequence of first-generation Spinach. For this purpose, we established a systematic screening procedure for single- and double-point mutations on a microfluidic large-scale integrated chip platform for 87-nt long RNAs. The thermodynamic profile with single base resolution was used to engineer an improved fluorogenic spinach generation via a directed rather than evolutional approach.</p>

<p>Recent genome projects for ctenophores have revealed the presence of numerous ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) in Mnemiopsis leidyi and Pleurobrachia bachei, among our earliest metazoan ancestors. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis show that these form a distinct clade from the well-characterized AMPA, kainate, and NMDA iGluR subtypes found in vertebrates....</p>

<h3><b>[Special Issue Report] Dust observations at orbital altitudes surrounding Mars</b></h3>
<p>Authors:L. Andersson<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Dust is common close to the martian surface, but no known process can lift appreciable concentrations of particles to altitudes above ~150 kilometers. We present observations of dust at altitudes ranging from 150 to above 1000 kilometers by the Langmuir Probe and Wave instrument on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution spacecraft. Based on its distribution, we interpret this dust to be interplanetary in origin. A comparison with laboratory measurements indicates that the dust grain size ranges from 1 to 12 micrometers, assuming a typical grain velocity of ~18 kilometers per second. These direct observations of dust entering the martian atmosphere improve our understanding of the sources, sinks, and transport of interplanetary dust throughout the inner solar system and the associated impacts on Mars’s atmosphere.

<h3><b>[Special Issue Research Article] Early MAVEN Deep Dip campaign reveals thermosphere and ionosphere variability</b></h3>
<p>Authors:S. Bougher<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission, during the second of its Deep Dip campaigns, made comprehensive measurements of martian thermosphere and ionosphere composition, structure, and variability at altitudes down to ~130 kilometers in the subsolar region. This altitude range contains the diffusively separated upper atmosphere just above the well-mixed atmosphere, the layer of peak extreme ultraviolet heating and primary reservoir for atmospheric escape. In situ measurements of the upper atmosphere reveal previously unmeasured populations of neutral and charged particles, the homopause altitude at approximately 130 kilometers, and an unexpected level of variability both on an orbit-to-orbit basis and within individual orbits. These observations help constrain volatile escape processes controlled by thermosphere and ionosphere structure and variability.

<h3><b>[Special Issue Research Article] MAVEN observations of the response of Mars to an interplanetary coronal mass ejection</b></h3>
<p>Authors:B. M. Jakosky<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Coupling between the lower and upper atmosphere, combined with loss of gas from the upper atmosphere to space, likely contributed to the thin, cold, dry atmosphere of modern Mars. To help understand ongoing ion loss to space, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft made comprehensive measurements of the Mars upper atmosphere, ionosphere, and interactions with the Sun and solar wind during an interplanetary coronal mass ejection impact in March 2015. Responses include changes in the bow shock and magnetosheath, formation of widespread diffuse aurora, and enhancement of pick-up ions. Observations and models both show an enhancement in escape rate of ions to space during the event. Ion loss during solar events early in Mars history may have been a major contributor to the long-term evolution of the Mars atmosphere.

<h3><b>[Special Issue Research Article] Discovery of diffuse aurora on Mars</b></h3>
<p>Authors:N. M. Schneider<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Planetary auroras reveal the complex interplay between an atmosphere and the surrounding plasma environment. We report the discovery of low-altitude, diffuse auroras spanning much of Mars’ northern hemisphere, coincident with a solar energetic particle outburst. The Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph, a remote sensing instrument on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft, detected auroral emission in virtually all nightside observations for ~5 days, spanning nearly all geographic longitudes. Emission extended down to ~60 kilometer (km) altitude (1 microbar), deeper than confirmed at any other planet. Solar energetic particles were observed up to 200 kilo­–electron volts; these particles are capable of penetrating down to the 60 km altitude. Given minimal magnetic fields over most of the planet, Mars is likely to exhibit auroras more globally than Earth.

<h3><b>[Editorial] Eradicating polio</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Anthony Adams<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>On 20 September 2015, the Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication (GCC) declared that type 2 wild poliovirus had been eradicated. The GCC examined reports from 189 of 195 countries around the world and studied separate data [held by the World Health Organization (WHO)] from the remaining countries. According to WHO, nearly 2 million appropriate clinical samples had been tested, and no type 2 wild polioviruses were found. The announcement is the first step toward eradicating all three wild poliovirus types. But this landmark will only be declared when the GCC is confident that there have been no wild virus cases of any type for 3 years.

<h3><b>[In Depth] How buried water makes diamonds and oil</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Eric Hand<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Under high pressures, water can react with surrounding rock to make diamonds and oil. These are just two consequences of a new picture of water's versatile chemistry in the mantle. The Deep Earth Water model is showing that, under extreme pressures down to 200 kilometers, water can dissolve many ions and host unexpected new reactions. It is replacing a geochemical framework, published in 1981, which made predictions for water-rock interactions, but only down to 15 kilometers. The idea that oil can be made from water and rock in the mantle is controversial, because it has long been assumed that oil arises through the compaction and burial of organic matter.

<h3><b>[In Depth] Microbes aid cancer drugs</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Mitch Leslie<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>A new class of cancer treatments that unleash the power of the immune system on tumors may depend on some unlikely allies. Two studies of mice in this week's issue of Science demonstrate that the gut microbiome—the swarms of microorganisms dwelling in the intestines—determines how effective these cancer immunotherapies are. Known as checkpoint inhibitors, the therapies foil one of cancer's most devious survival tricks: its ability to turn off the immune response that might otherwise attack tumor cells. In one case, researchers found that a checkpoint inhibitor targeting CTLA4, a molecule on T cells, works best in mice if their guts contain bacteria in the Bacteroides and Burkholderia genera. In the other, a drug targeting PD-L1 showed a similar dependency on members of the genus Bifidobacterium.

<h3><b>[In Depth] Data check: How a $30 billion hike becomes $3 billion</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Jeffrey Mervis<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>The new 2-year budget that President Barack Obama signed this week has raised the hopes of research advocates that individual agencies may be in line for increases of roughly 5% in 2016. But the good news, which hinges on Congress passing a bill covering spending for every federal agency, is tempered by the fine print in the deal. The problem comes in the second year of the agreement, which raises the current spending ceiling by $50 billion in 2016 and $30 billion in 2017. The 2017 increase is calculated not from 2016 levels but from what it would otherwise have been under a 10-year budget agreement struck in 2011 that remains in effect. In reality, the 2017 budget bump will be only $3 billion more than 2016 levels, leaving scientists feeling once again that research is being squeezed.

<h3><b>[In Depth] Pacific Rim mathematicians coaxed from their ivory towers</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Dennis Normile<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>In popular culture, mathematicians are portrayed as the most aloof of academics. But increasing numbers of academic mathematicians are applying their knowledge and skills to industrial challenges. This trend is now catching on in the Asia-Pacific region, with countries supporting new institutes, grant programs, and brainstorming sessions. Mathematicians in Japan are working with corporate partners to apply stochastic differential equations to manage financial transactions, group theory to improve computer graphics, and topology—the study of surface deformation—to optimize steelmaking. Their South Korean counterparts are modeling how drugs reach target organs, developing new approaches to analyzing big data sets, and delving into the complex geometry of computer animation. In New Zealand, math specialists are at work thwarting shoplifters and even helping grass grow.

<h3><b>[In Depth] India orders premier labs to pay their own way</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Shruti Ravindran<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>India's Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has boosted the country's economy by fostering a booming generic drugs industry and devising new approaches to hybrid crops. Now, the network of 38 national laboratories needs to nurture its own finances. The central government, intent on curbing domestic spending, feels CSIR's $600 million budget is a luxury it can no longer afford and has given the labs 2 to 3 years to "self-finance" half their expenditures by winning grants, licensing discoveries, and collaborating with industry. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government insists it is not hostile to research: Rather, it wants R&amp;D to better serve national interests. But the self-financing directive has riled many in India's scientific community.

<h3><b>[In Depth] Using evolution to better identify cell types</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Elizabeth Pennisi<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Just as evolutionary biologists now know that similarities in form and function are no guarantee that distinct species are actually related, cell biologists are finding the same is true about cells. And just as evolutionary biologists now look to the DNA of organisms to understand their relationships, cell biologists should classify cells genetically as well, a small group of researchers now argues. Because each cell in an organism has the same set of genes, however, the idea is to instead use each cell type's distinctive pattern of gene activity. That approach has revealed that neurons in a variety of animals have two sources—from the tip of the embryo and from what becomes the animal's trunk, suggesting independent evolutionary origins as well. This approach is helping clarify the nature and origin of specialized cells in the mammalian uterus called decidual cells and, ultimately, has broad explanatory power.

<h3><b>[In Depth] Vitamin C could target some common cancers</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Jocelyn Kaiser<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Decades ago, Nobel Prize–winning chemist Linus Pauling was relegated to the fringes of medicine after championing the idea that vitamin C could combat a host of medical conditions, including cancer. Now, a study published online this week by Science reports that vitamin C can kill tumor cells that carry a common cancer-causing mutation and, in mice, can curb the growth of tumors with the mutation. If the findings hold up in people, researchers may have found a way to treat a large swath of tumors that have lacked effective drugs. Because high dose vitamin C is already known to be safe, clinical trials to test this idea could move ahead quickly.

<h3><b>[Feature] Eggs unlimited</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Jennifer Couzin-Frankel<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>A controversial fertility company called OvaScience is preoccupied by an enduring mystery in human biology—why eggs fail—and the palpable hope that we can do something about it. The company offers a new treatment, called AUGMENT, based on what it considers to be egg precursor cells found in a woman's ovaries. AUGMENT, which costs UP TO $25,000, along with thousands more in clinic fees and roughly $25,000 for the in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle that must accompany it, relies on mitochondria from putative egg precursor cells to boost the success of IVF. Seventeen babies have been born so far. The company, which has attracted hundreds of millions of dollars from investors, is poised to introduce a second treatment. But many scientists doubt that egg precursor cells actually exist.

<h3><b>[Perspective] Dengue vaccines at a crossroad</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Annelies Wilder-Smith<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>The era when most vaccines provided efficacy well beyond 90% is over. Many of the more recently developed vaccines only provide partial efficacy. Although vaccines are typically licensed on the basis of demonstrated efficacy, the ultimate goal of vaccination goes far beyond efficacy. In addition to averting disease and death at an individual level, vaccination programs should decrease the public health burden of diseases at the population level. What counts is the impact on the reduction of vaccine-preventable disease incidence through direct and indirect protection, which is particularly pertinent for diseases that are of high public health importance.

<h3><b>[Perspective] A pancreatic clock times insulin release</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Charna Dibner<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>The circadian timing system plays an essential role in the temporal coordination of metabolism in health and disease (1). This includes maintaining blood glucose homeostasis, a process that is regulated to a large extent by insulin. Cell-autonomous circadian oscillators—molecular “clocks”—operate in virtually all body cells. On page 650 of this issue, Perelis et al. report that the circadian clock specific to islet beta cells in the pancreas controls the release of insulin as a response to blood glucose levels in a manner that is dependent on the time of day (2).

<h3><b>[Perspective] Love at second sight for CO2 and H2 in organic synthesis</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Jürgen Klankermayer<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Many romantic comedies are based on a couple with opposite personalities who fall in love, lose track of each other, and reunite against all odds, most often with the help of a mediator. This cinematic scenario recaps the recent progress in bringing together two molecular actors, carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2), with the help of homogeneous catalysts in solution. Of the pair, CO2 is the reluctant partner; it is thermodynamically very stable and kinetically inert in typical organic syntheses. However, an energetic partner such as H2 can bring out its reactivity if their combination is properly directed. Organometallic catalysts have recently opened new possibilities to merge this odd couple of CO2 and H2 and, with the support of helpful in-laws (co-reactants), to establish synthetic methods for sustainable chemical processes across the chemical value chain.

<h3><b>[Perspective] Frustrating a quantum magnet</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Yuji Furukawa<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Being able to determine the ground state of a frustrated quantum magnet has been a long-sought goal in condensed matter physics. In general, frustration results from the inability to achieve a desired outcome. In solid-state systems, frustration can arise in relation to electron spin, one of an electron's degrees of freedom. The antiferromagnetic (AFM) interaction between electron spins means that the spins minimize their energy by orienting opposite to their neighbors. For example, if spin A was “up,” spin B would be “down,” antiparallel to spin A. However, introducing the third spin, as in an antiferromagnetically coupled equilateral triangle of electron spins, presents frustration (see the figure, panel A). Here, spin C cannot simultaneously satisfy the up-down interactions with spins A and B. Because spin C cannot achieve its “desired outcome” of being oppositely aligned with both its nearest neighbors, it is “frustrated.” On page 655 of this issue, Fu et al. (1) investigate the ground state of such a system by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to measure the intrinsic low-energy spin excitation of the ideal frustrated quantum magnet ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2.

<h3><b>[Policy Forum] Evidence gaps and ethical review of multicenter studies</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Ann-Margret Ervin<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Large, multicenter clinical studies are the backbone of evidence-based prevention and health care. Ethical review of multicenter research is usually conducted by the institutional review board (IRB) of each participating institution. However, variation in interpretation of regulations by IRBs is common and can have ethical and scientific implications (1, 2). Recent mandates in the United States aim to reduce the administrative burden and to expedite multicenter research by conducting ethical review with a single, central IRB of record (CIRB). Yet the quality of ethical review must not suffer. We characterize current models of ethical review in the United States and identify research gaps that must be addressed before such policies are instituted.

<h3><b>[Perspective] The epigenome—a family affair</b></h3>
<p>Authors:John R. McCarrey<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Classic dogma has dictated that, in animals, genetic mechanisms in general, and DNA sequence in particular, are responsible for transmission of traits from one generation to the next. However, an increasing number of reports over the past decade have shown that epigenetic mechanisms can also contribute to transgenerational inheritance (1). This is important because it implies that effects to which your parents or grandparents were exposed, even if not directly mutagenic, may alter your phenotype or that of your children or grandchildren. Previous studies implicated disruptions in DNA methylation patterns as the molecular basis for this type of epigenetic inheritance (2), but on page 651 of this issue, Siklenka et al. (3) show that disruption of histone modifications, in the apparent absence of any changes in DNA methylation patterns, can also form the basis for transgenerational transmission of epigenetic programming defects that can modify phenotypic characteristics in subsequent generations.

<h3><b>[Perspective] How to isolate americium</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Chuck Soderquist<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Americium is a highly radioactive element found in used nuclear fuel. Because used commercial fuels always contain americium, chemical fuel processing must include separation of this element. Americium is easy to recover concurrently with eight other elements in the fuel (the lanthanide elements) but much more difficult to isolate free of those other eight. On page 652 of this issue, Dares et al. report a method that may provide a simple route to isolating americium (1).

<h3><b>[Perspective] A new dawn for cataracts</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Roy A. Quinlan<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Cataract, a clouding of the eye lens, is the major cause of blindness in the world, accounting for about 20 million cases (1). Treatment is surgical—the opaque, cataractous lens is replaced with an artificial, plastic one. Many people in the developing world become blind due to cataracts because of a lack of medical resources. A new drug treatment for cataracts based on eye drops would remove this obstacle, as current agents and dietary recommendations are generally ineffective. The findings of Makley et al. (2) reported on page 674 of this issue, and by Zhao et al. (3) may substantially boost the cataract pharmacopoeia.

<h3><b>[Book Review] The cultural evolution</b></h3>

<p>In The Evolution of Everything, Matt Ridley attempts to demonstrate that the complex systems that define the modern world, including our economies, educational systems, population structures, governments, and religions, emerged on their own and did not arise as a result of purposeful human action. While conceding that we may sometimes give ourselves more credit than we're due, reviewer Richard Gawne takes issue with Ridley's repeated accusations of "creationism," and is troubled by the assertion that we should accept the inevitable, especially with regard to climate change.

<h3><b>[Review] Microbiomes in light of traits: A phylogenetic perspective</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Jennifer B. H. Martiny<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>A focus on the phenotypic characteristics of microorganisms—their traits—offers a path for interpreting the growing amount of microbiome data. We review key aspects of microbial traits, as well as approaches used to assay their phylogenetic distribution. Recent studies reveal that microbial traits are differentially conserved across the tree of life and appear to be conserved in a hierarchical fashion, possibly linked to their biochemical complexity. These results suggest a predictive framework whereby the genetic (or taxonomic) resolution of microbiome variation among samples provides information about the traits under selection. The organizational parallels seen among human and free-living microbiomes seem to support this idea. Developments in this framework may offer predictions not only for how microbial composition responds to changing environmental conditions, but also for how these changes may alter the health or functioning in human, engineered, and environmental systems.

<h3><b>[Research Article] Disruption of histone methylation in developing sperm impairs offspring health transgenerationally</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Keith Siklenka<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>A father’s lifetime experiences can be transmitted to his offspring to affect health and development. However, the mechanisms underlying paternal epigenetic transmission are unclear. Unlike in somatic cells, there are few nucleosomes in sperm, and their function in epigenetic inheritance is unknown. We generated transgenic mice in which overexpression of the histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylase KDM1A (also known as LSD1) during spermatogenesis reduced H3K4 dimethylation in sperm. KDM1A overexpression in one generation severely impaired development and survivability of offspring. These defects persisted transgenerationally in the absence of KDM1A germline expression and were associated with altered RNA profiles in sperm and offspring. We show that epigenetic inheritance of aberrant development can be initiated by histone demethylase activity in developing sperm, without changes to DNA methylation at CpG-rich regions.

<h3><b>[Research Article] Pancreatic β cell enhancers regulate rhythmic transcription of genes controlling insulin secretion</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Mark Perelis<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>The mammalian transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1 are essential components of the molecular clock that coordinate behavior and metabolism with the solar cycle. Genetic or environmental perturbation of circadian cycles contributes to metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes. To study the impact of the cell-autonomous clock on pancreatic β cell function, we examined pancreatic islets from mice with either intact or disrupted BMAL1 expression both throughout life and limited to adulthood. We found pronounced oscillation of insulin secretion that was synchronized with the expression of genes encoding secretory machinery and signaling factors that regulate insulin release. CLOCK/BMAL1 colocalized with the pancreatic transcription factor PDX1 within active enhancers distinct from those controlling rhythmic metabolic gene networks in liver. We also found that β cell clock ablation in adult mice caused severe glucose intolerance. Thus, cell type–specific enhancers underlie the circadian control of peripheral metabolism throughout life and may help to explain its dysregulation in diabetes.

<h3><b>[Report] Electrochemical oxidation of 243Am(III) in nitric acid by a terpyridyl-derivatized electrode</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Christopher J. Dares<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Selective oxidation of trivalent americium (Am) could facilitate its separation from lanthanides in nuclear waste streams. Here, we report the application of a high-surface-area, tin-doped indium oxide electrode surface-derivatized with a terpyridine ligand to the oxidation of Am(III) to Am(V) and Am(VI) in nitric acid. Potentials as low as 1.8 volts (V) versus the saturated calomel electrode were applied, 0.7 V lower than the 2.6 V potential for one-electron oxidation of Am(III) to Am(IV) in 1 molar acid. This simple electrochemical procedure provides a method to access the higher oxidation states of Am in noncomplexing media for the study of the associated coordination chemistry and, more important, for more efficient separation protocols.

<h3><b>[Report] Evidence for a gapped spin-liquid ground state in a kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Mingxuan Fu<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>The kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet is a leading candidate in the search for a spin system with a quantum spin-liquid ground state. The nature of its ground state remains a matter of active debate. We conducted oxygen-17 single-crystal nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of the spin-1/2 kagome lattice in herbertsmithite [ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2], which is known to exhibit a spinon continuum in the spin excitation spectrum. We demonstrated that the intrinsic local spin susceptibility χkagome, deduced from the oxygen-17 NMR frequency shift, asymptotes to zero below temperatures of 0.03J, where J ~ 200 kelvin is the copper-copper superexchange interaction. Combined with the magnetic field dependence of χkagome that we observed at low temperatures, these results imply that the kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet has a spin-liquid ground state with a finite gap.

<h3><b>[Report] Creation of a low-entropy quantum gas of polar molecules in an optical lattice</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Steven A. Moses<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Ultracold polar molecules, with their long-range electric dipolar interactions, offer a unique platform for studying correlated quantum many-body phenomena. However, realizing a highly degenerate quantum gas of molecules with a low entropy per particle is challenging. We report the synthesis of a low-entropy quantum gas of potassium-rubidium molecules (KRb) in a three-dimensional optical lattice. We simultaneously load into the optical lattice a Mott insulator of bosonic Rb atoms and a single-band insulator of fermionic K atoms. Then, using magnetoassociation and optical state transfer, we efficiently produce ground-state molecules in the lattice at those sites that contain one Rb and one K atom. The achieved filling fraction of 25% should enable future studies of transport and entanglement propagation in a many-body system with long-range dipolar interactions.

<h3><b>[Report] The ecology of the microbiome: Networks, competition, and stability</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Katharine Z. Coyte<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>The human gut harbors a large and complex community of beneficial microbes that remain stable over long periods. This stability is considered critical for good health but is poorly understood. Here we develop a body of ecological theory to help us understand microbiome stability. Although cooperating networks of microbes can be efficient, we find that they are often unstable. Counterintuitively, this finding indicates that hosts can benefit from microbial competition when this competition dampens cooperative networks and increases stability. More generally, stability is promoted by limiting positive feedbacks and weakening ecological interactions. We have analyzed host mechanisms for maintaining stability—including immune suppression, spatial structuring, and feeding of community members—and support our key predictions with recent data.

<h3><b>[Report] Corticomotoneuronal cells are “functionally tuned”</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Darcy M. Griffin<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Corticomotoneuronal (CM) cells in the primary motor cortex (M1) have monosynaptic connections with motoneurons. They are one of the few sources of descending commands that directly influence motor output. We examined the contribution of CM cells to the generation of activity in their target muscles. The preferred direction of many CM cells differed from that of their target muscles. Some CM cells were selectively active when a muscle was used as an agonist. Others were selectively active when the same muscle was used as a synergist, fixator, or antagonist. These observations suggest that the different functional uses of a muscle are generated by separate populations of CM cells. We propose that muscle function is one of the dimensions represented in the output of M1.

<h3><b>[Report] Plant pathogenic anaerobic bacteria use aromatic polyketides to access aerobic territory</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Gulimila Shabuer<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Around 25% of vegetable food is lost worldwide because of infectious plant diseases, including microbe-induced decay of harvested crops. In wet seasons and under humid storage conditions, potato tubers are readily infected and decomposed by anaerobic bacteria (Clostridium puniceum). We found that these anaerobic plant pathogens harbor a gene locus (type II polyketide synthase) to produce unusual polyketide metabolites (clostrubins) with dual functions. The clostrubins, which act as antibiotics against other microbial plant pathogens, enable the anaerobic bacteria to survive an oxygen-rich plant environment.

<h3><b>[Report] Pharmacological chaperone for α-crystallin partially restores transparency in cataract models</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Leah N. Makley<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Cataracts reduce vision in 50% of individuals over 70 years of age and are a common form of blindness worldwide. Cataracts are caused when damage to the major lens crystallin proteins causes their misfolding and aggregation into insoluble amyloids. Using a thermal stability assay, we identified a class of molecules that bind α-crystallins (cryAA and cryAB) and reversed their aggregation in vitro. The most promising compound improved lens transparency in the R49C cryAA and R120G cryAB mouse models of hereditary cataract. It also partially restored protein solubility in the lenses of aged mice in vivo and in human lenses ex vivo. These findings suggest an approach to treating cataracts by stabilizing α-crystallins.

<h3><b>[Report] Operon structure and cotranslational subunit association direct protein assembly in bacteria</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Yu-Wei Shieh<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Assembly of protein complexes is considered a posttranslational process involving random collision of subunits. We show that within the Escherichia coli cytosol, bacterial luciferase subunits LuxA and LuxB assemble into complexes close to the site of subunit synthesis. Assembly efficiency decreases markedly if subunits are synthesized on separate messenger RNAs from genes integrated at distant chromosomal sites. Subunit assembly initiates cotranslationally on nascent LuxB in vivo. The ribosome-associated chaperone trigger factor delays the onset of cotranslational interactions until the LuxB dimer interface is fully exposed. Protein assembly is thus directly coupled to the translation process and involves spatially confined, actively chaperoned cotranslational subunit interactions. Bacterial gene organization into operons therefore reflects a fundamental cotranslational mechanism for spatial and temporal regulation that is vital to effective assembly of protein complexes.

<p>Authors:Takatoshi Arakawa<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Anion exchanger 1 (AE1), also known as band 3 or SLC4A1, plays a key role in the removal of carbon dioxide from tissues by facilitating the exchange of chloride and bicarbonate across the plasma membrane of erythrocytes. An isoform of AE1 is also present in the kidney. Specific mutations in human AE1 cause several types of hereditary hemolytic anemias and/or distal renal tubular acidosis. Here we report the crystal structure of the band 3 anion exchanger domain (AE1CTD) at 3.5 angstroms. The structure is locked in an outward-facing open conformation by an inhibitor. Comparing this structure with a substrate-bound structure of the uracil transporter UraA in an inward-facing conformation allowed us to identify the anion-binding position in the AE1CTD, and to propose a possible transport mechanism that could explain why selected mutations lead to disease.

<h3><b>[Report] The Papaver rhoeas S determinants confer self-incompatibility to Arabidopsis thaliana in planta</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Zongcheng Lin<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Self-incompatibility (SI) is a major genetically controlled system used to prevent inbreeding in higher plants. S determinants regulate allele-specific rejection of “self” pollen by the pistil. SI is an important model system for cell-to-cell recognition and signaling and could be potentially useful for first-generation (F1) hybrid breeding. To date, the transfer of S determinants has used the complementation of orthologs to “restore” SI in close relatives. We expressed the Papaver rhoeas S determinants PrsS and PrpS in Arabidopsis thaliana. This enabled pistils to reject pollen expressing cognate PrpS. Moreover, plants coexpressing cognate PrpS and PrsS exhibit robust SI. This demonstrates that PrsS and PrpS are sufficient for a functional synthetic S locus in vivo. This transfer of novel S determinants into a highly divergent species (&gt;140 million years apart) with no orthologs suggests their potential utility in crop production.

<h3><b>[Report] A cucurbit androecy gene reveals how unisexual flowers develop and dioecy emerges</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Adnane Boualem<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Understanding the evolution of sex determination in plants requires identifying the mechanisms underlying the transition from monoecious plants, where male and female flowers coexist, to unisexual individuals found in dioecious species. We show that in melon and cucumber, the androecy gene controls female flower development and encodes a limiting enzyme of ethylene biosynthesis, ACS11. ACS11 is expressed in phloem cells connected to flowers programmed to become female, and ACS11 loss-of-function mutants lead to male plants (androecy). CmACS11 represses the expression of the male promoting gene CmWIP1 to control the development and the coexistence of male and female flowers in monoecious species. Because monoecy can lead to dioecy, we show how a combination of alleles of CmACS11 and CmWIP1 can create artificial dioecy.

<h3><b>[Report] The Symbiodinium kawagutii genome illuminates dinoflagellate gene expression and coral symbiosis</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Senjie Lin<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Dinoflagellates are important components of marine ecosystems and essential coral symbionts, yet little is known about their genomes. We report here on the analysis of a high-quality assembly from the 1180-megabase genome of Symbiodinium kawagutii. We annotated protein-coding genes and identified Symbiodinium-specific gene families. No whole-genome duplication was observed, but instead we found active (retro)transposition and gene family expansion, especially in processes important for successful symbiosis with corals. We also documented genes potentially governing sexual reproduction and cyst formation, novel promoter elements, and a microRNA system potentially regulating gene expression in both symbiont and coral. We found biochemical complementarity between genomes of S. kawagutii and the anthozoan Acropora, indicative of host-symbiont coevolution, providing a resource for studying the molecular basis and evolution of coral symbiosis.

<h3><b>[Business Office Feature] 
Single-molecule localization microscopy comes of age: From concepts to biological impact
</b></h3>
<p>Authors:Markus Sauer<br>
Date: 2015-11-06</p>
<p>Superresolution microscopy by single-molecule photoactivation or photoswitching and position determination (localization microscopy) has the potential to fundamentally revolutionize our understanding of how cells function at a molecular level. Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) can provide single-molecule information about the distribution and even the absolute numbers of proteins in subcellular compartments. During this webinar, our speakers will introduce the basic requirements of SMLM and its potential use for quantitative molecular imaging. Obstacles and how to bypass them will be discussed, as well as the advantages of direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) for quantitative imaging of proteins. Furthermore, the influence of different environmental and artificial variables on the survival of different cell lines will be demonstrated. The speakers will present data on different image capture technologies for SMLM, focusing on electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) and scientific complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (sCMOS) cameras, discussing frame rates and the need for sensitive detectors to harvest the comparatively low light levels associated with single-molecule fluorescence emission. Information on how to optimize your camera setup for superresolution imaging will also be provided.View the Webinar
